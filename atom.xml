    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47978121/gsoc/multiple_panes.png" alt="Nyaplot multi-pane example" /></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Last week I implemented the multiple panes interactivity to the
front-end of Nyaplot. You can see the demo on <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/domitry/Nyaplot/blob/master/examples/notebook/Introduction.ipynb">this notebook</a>.</p>

<p>Skip over single pane demo, and have a look at the paragraph &#8216;Multiple
panes demo&#8217; at the bottom. In this example, the histogram and bar chart are
created individually, and then thrown into one instance of
Nyaplot::Frame. After running <code>frame.show</code>, both of the diagrams
appear in one out-put box on the notebook. When you click the
histogram, bar chart refrects that and change its height.</p>

<p>In this article I will explain about the event handler of Nyaplot,
which allows for interactivity among panes.</p>

<h2>The Trick</h2>

<p>The trick is actually hidden in Nyaplot::DataFrame. In this example,
both of the two diagrams are generated from columns in one DataFrame.
When Nyaplot receives a column object (instance of <code>Nyaplot::Series</code>,
defined
<a href="https://github.com/domitry/nyaplot/blob/master/lib/nyaplot/data.rb#L115">here</a>), it
internally find its source data frame and remembers its location.</p>

<p>Consequently, Nyaplot can find that histogram and bar chart are
sharing their data source, and allows them to interact with each other.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47978121/gsoc/table.png" alt="Nyaplot::DataFrame Example" /></p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>Before explaining the event handler, I want to outline Nyaplot&#8217;s
diagram rendering procedure. In the back-end JavaScript library,
diagrams, such as histograms, fetch column data from data frames and generate
their SVG DOM nodes dynamically (<a href="https://github.com/domitry/Nyaplotjs/blob/master/src/view/diagrams/histogram.js#L20">source code</a>).</p>

<p>The key is <a href="https://github.com/domitry/Nyaplotjs/blob/master/src/utils/dataframe.js">a data frame written in JavaScript</a>. After mouse events
coming from a filter (such as the gray box on the plot area) are
handled, the histogram <a href="https://github.com/domitry/Nyaplotjs/blob/master/src/view/diagrams/histogram.js#L96">registers its filter function to the data frame and instructs all diagrams to update their SVG DOM objects</a>. The bar chart <a href="https://github.com/domitry/Nyaplotjs/blob/master/src/view/diagrams/bar.js#L54">updates its SVG from data filtered by the new function</a>.</p>

<p>As you can see, Nyaplot&#8217;s inner workings are fairly simple; and these
workings are common to all diagrams supported by Nyaplot. So not only
the histogram and bar chart, but other diagrams as well, can behave
interactively (e.g., <a href="http://www.domitry.com/gsoc/multi_pane2.html">histogram, bar, and Venn example</a>).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Despite, or perhaps because of, the relative simplicity of the
structure, the event handler functions well. The actual interactivity
in Nyaplot is based on the data frame object, both in the
Ruby front-end and the JavaScript back-end. As a result, handling
events in DataFrame is both natural and efficient for Nyaplot.</p>

<h2>Additional Information</h2>

<p>Nyaplot and its back-end library Nyaplotjs are being developed on GitHub.</p>

    <link href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2014/07/02/usage-integration-gem-improvements/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-02T17:43:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2014/07/02/usage-integration-gem-improvements</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Numerical Integration</h2>

<p>Integration is the process of finding the summation of the value of a function at small intervals, when the width of the intervals is infinitesimally small.
As there is no such thing as &#8220;infinitesimally small interval&#8221;, there are several other methods which help us to approximate the values of integrals.</p>

<p>Numerical integration is one such technique which helps us to estimate the value of the definite integral of a function over an interval.
Numerical integration is based on the principle of evaluating the values of a function at specific points in the interval and then taking the product of those values with a corresponding weight, which is a standard constant specific to the method being used.</p>

<h2>Integration Gem</h2>

<p>The Integration gem is now equipped with a host of additional algorithms for approximating the integral of a function ranging from the simple ones like Simpson&#8217;s method to the more complex ones like Gauss&ndash;Kronrod and Adaptive Quadrature method.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Let us say you need to find out the integral of a function <code>5*x**2 -7*Math.cos(x)</code> over the interval <code>(0,1)</code>.
We can solve this using the following snippet using the Integration gem:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Integration</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">integrate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,{</span><span class="ss">:method</span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="ss">:simpson</span><span class="p">})</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">**</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="no">Math</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cos</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># =&gt; -4.223630227110514</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We see that the actual value of this integral is <code>-4.2236302269886088799000849584</code>, which is pretty close to the value estimated by the integration gem.
Instead of <code>{:method=&gt;:simpson}</code> in the above code, you can use any one of these implemented methods:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">rectangle</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="ss">:trapezoid</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="ss">:simpson</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:adaptive_quadrature</span> <span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:gauss</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:romberg</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:monte_carlo</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:gauss_kronrod</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:simpson3by8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:boole</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:open_trapezoid</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:milne</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Each of these algorithms gives similar results &mdash; except if the function has rapid changes in the interval of integration, as is the nature of numerical integration.</p>

    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2014/07/02/progress-of-d3-project</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week is the half-way point of this year&#8217;s Google Summer of Code. Let me report the progress during the term.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47978121/gsoc/nyaoplot_top.png" alt="Example Nyaplot chart" /></p>

<h2>Progress on the front-end library</h2>

<p>I am developing <a href="https://github.com/domitry/Nyaplot">Nyaplot</a> as the front-end library for my work.</p>

<p>One topic on Nyaplot is API design. That is a difficult problem since each plotting library has very different methods for creating plots. For example, matplotlib and Bokeh are both written in Python, but their demo code is written in very different styles. After discussing with my mentor, I decided to implement the function-based API.</p>

<p>As an exmaple of that API, here is a minimal working example for generating bar charts with Nyaplot:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;nyaplot&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">plot</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Nyaplot</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Plot</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">plot</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:bar</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;nya1&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;nya2&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;nya3&#39;</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">30</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">plot</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">show</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you want to change options (e.g., color or title), put the return value of Nyaplot::Plot.add into a variable and call its methods.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">bar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">plot</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:bar</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;nya1&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;nya2&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;nya3&#39;</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">30</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">)</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>IRuby integration</h2>

<p>Interaction with <a href="https://github.com/minad/iruby">IRuby</a> is a priority for Nyaplot. IRuby is a web-based Ruby lab notebook-like environment, based on IPython, which is also useful for fast prototyping.</p>

<p>The image on top of this blog post is a hyperbolic spiral which I generated with Nyaplot in
IRuby. <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/domitry/Nyaplot/blob/master/examples/notebook/Introduction.ipynb">Have a look at the notebook</a> on nbviewer, an IRuby and IPython notebook hosting services.</p>

<h2>Progress on the back-end library</h2>

<p>Nyaplot uses <a href="https://github.com/domitry/Nyaplotjs">Nyaplotjs</a> as its back-end library. I spent a lot of time to implement interactivity among multiple panes to Nyaplotjs. See <a href="http://www.domitry.com/gsoc/">an example</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47978121/gsoc/top.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>The input data source is a TSV file of 2,044 lines. Multiple-pane interactivity is especially important when visualizing such a large dataset.</p>

<p>Have a look at the radio buttons beside the Venn diagram. The left three panels decide which set to put into each of 3 circles (VENN1, VENN2, VENN3). The right panel decides which data in each area (overlapping area, non-overlapping area, and all) to use in the other two panes.</p>

<p>The gray box on the histogram decides the range of PNR values. If you select the
range 0.3 to 0.7 with it, the right bar chart will reflect that and show how many
of the selected data are in that range.</p>

<p>Nyaplotjs provides this interactivity using an event handler connected to a dataframe object. That
allows us to handle unidirectional update method (e.g., histogram updates bar chart, but bar chart does not update histogram).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I finished the first half term of Google Summer of Code 2014, but I still have a lot of
things to do. I would like to continue to add interactivity to both the front-end and back-end libraries.</p>

<p>I am developing those two libraries in separate repositories on GitHub. If you are interested, feel free to raise issues or send pull-requests, even during the GSoC term.</p>

    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2014/06/24/updates-minimization-and-integration</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Minimization</h2>

<p>The Minimization gem now supports the following unidimensional function minimizations
provided by GSL. The supported methods include the pure Ruby implementations of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Newton&ndash;Raphson</li>
<li>Golden Section</li>
<li>Brent</li>
<li>Quad Golden</li>
</ol>


<p>Of these, the Golden Section, Brent, and Quad Golden are also
available via Minimization&#8217;s GSL interface (and are thus
faster). Everything is organized in such a way that the faster C code
(i.e., GSL) will be executed when GSL is available, but that otherwise
the Ruby implementation will be used. I still have to beautify the
code and add documentation.</p>

<h2>Integration</h2>

<p>The Integration gem has been transitioned from Hoe to Bundler. For
Gauss&ndash;Kronrod Quadrature, I have hard-coded the values of nodes
and weights (for 15, 21, 31, 41, and 61 points) &#8212; which were already
hardcoded in the case of the Gauss quadrature.</p>

<p>Additionally, I added basic methods like Simpson&#8217;s Three-Eighths
Method, Milne&#8217;s Method, Boole&#8217;s Quadrature and Open Trapezoid.</p>

<p>This week, I will be reviewing a <a href="https://github.com/clbustos/integration/pull/3">pull request</a> which aims to change the structure of the whole Integration gem.</p>

<p>After that I plan to implement more adaptive methods and incorporate
the non-adaptive methods under a single Newton&ndash;Cotes function.</p>

<p>Lastly, I am brainstorming designs for symbolic integration using
JScience and JRuby.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Current Progress on Minimization Gem</h2>

<p>In the first half of the summer, I plan to introduce some new numerical minimization methods to SciRuby&#8217;s Minimization gem. As per my proposal, I began by implementing the Powell&#8217;s multidimensional minimization method. Powell&#8217;s method has a better convergence in most cases than the Nelder&ndash;Mead algorithm, and is also a multidimensional minimization method which doesn&#8217;t use any derivative of the function.</p>

<p>I started by studying SciPy and Apache Commons library&#8217;s Powell&#8217;s optimizer. I decided to base my implementation on the method from the <a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/">Apache Commons Mathematics Library</a>. Powell&#8217;s method requires a line minimum searching algorithm, for which I used Brent minimizer (already available in SciRuby).</p>

<p>Having finished with Powell&#8217;s method, I am now working on the Fletcher&#8211;Reeves minimization method &mdash; a gradient method which uses the first derivative of the integrating function.</p>

working on numerical minimization and integration this summer, Rajat and
Lahiru. Rajat&#8217;s introductory post appeared two weeks ago.</p>


<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p>I&#8217;m Lahiru Lasandun and I&#8217;m an undergraduate of University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. I&#8217;ve been selected for
Google Summer of Code 2014 for SciRuby&#8217;s Minimization and Integration projects.</p>

<p>I was working with SciRuby about a month before GSOC started and did some tests on how to enhance the performance of
these numerical computations. My first idea was to use multi-threading. With the instuctions and guidance of mentors, I
tested more methods such as Erlang multi-processing, the AKKA package of multi-threading, and finally OpenCL. The final
decision was to use OpenCL to enhance computation power of these mathematical computations with the support of multi-cores
and GPUs.</p>

<h2>Minimization Gem</h2>

<p>After GSOC started, I began working on SciRuby&#8217;s Minimization gem. I proposed multidimensional minimization methods for the
Minimization gem, which already had plenty of unidimensional minimization methods. I chose two non-gradient
and two gradient minimization methods as well as simulated annealing.</p>

<h2>Integration Gem</h2>

<p>For Integration, I proposed to replicate some unidimensional integration methods from the GNU Scientific Library, GSL. Additionally, I proposed to add OpenCL support to enhance performance of integration methods.</p>

<h2>Current Progress</h2>

<p>Currently, I am working on Nelder&ndash;Mead multidimensional minimization
method which is a non-gradient method, including working on the relevant
test cases.</p>

<h2>Introduction to the Minimization and Integration Project</h2>

<p>Hi. My name is Rajat Kapoor and I have been selected to work with
SciRuby for Google Summer of Code 2014.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/minimization">Minimization</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/integration">Integration</a> are two of the
many available gems in the SciRuby suite. My project this year aims to
improve these gems to replicate the functionality provided by GNU&#8217;s
GSL. I will be trying to implement all the minimization and
integration algorithms present in GSL in pure Ruby, with improvements
as needed, so that these functions are easily accesible to all Ruby
users, while the users which have GSL already installed will have an
advantage in terms of speedy computations.</p>

<h2>What Minimization and Integration actually mean</h2>

<p>Minimization refers to the process of finding out the minimum of a
mathematical function whose values might depend on multiple
variables. Unidimensional minimization restricts these problems to
functions of one single variable. Integration is the same as the very
widely used concept in calculus which basically boils down to finding
the summation of the value of a function at small intervals, when the
width of the intervals in infinitesimally small. I can bet that you
knowingly or unknowingly use both these things on a daily basis.</p>

<h2>The plan</h2>

<p>The project can be broken into two major parts: Minimization and
Integration, as these are two seperate gems.</p>

<p>The Minimization gem can be broken in two parts: unidimensional (or
univariate) and multidimensional (multivariate). With respect to
coding, these two can again be broken down into sub-parts: pure Ruby
implementations and GSL support. The Integration gem will include
the pure Ruby implementations as well as GSL support. Along with this,
some support for symbolic integration will be added for JRuby
users by way of the JScience library.</p>

<h2>Progress</h2>

<p>The pure Ruby implementations of the unidimensional minimization part
are almost finished. I am also working on the GSL support for the same
along with it. I plan to finish up any unidimensional minimization
work by the end of this week and start the work with multidimensional
minimization methods.</p>

<p>Keep watching this blog for more updates regarding my project.</p>

    <link href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2014/06/04/introducing-the-fftw-sciruby-gsoc-project/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-04T12:30:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2014/06/04/introducing-the-fftw-sciruby-gsoc-project</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My name is Magdalen Berns and I am a physics student with a technical
background in live audio. I am particularly interested in using science
and technology to improve access for all.</p>

<p>This summer, I will be working on implementing the external library
appropriately named &#8220;Fastest Fourier Transform in the West&#8221; version 3
(FFTW3) C and Fortran API in Ruby for this year&#8217;s Google Summer of Code
(GSoC).</p>

<p>The primary aim of the project is to give SciRuby the capability to
handle signal analysis, processing and synthesis by performing discrete
fast Fourier transform operations on NMatrix objects.</p>

<p>After some investigation during the preparation stages of GSoC, it was
determined that implementing FFTW3 is more desirable than starting from
scratch in pure Ruby because the FFTW3 API is already extensively used,
developed, and optimised far beyond what would be achievable in just
three months. So, putting FFTW3 in the driving seat allows the SciRuby
project to take advantage of the good work of the FFTW3 developers by
bringing it to Ruby.</p>

<p>Putting NMatrix to the test with FFTW3 should give users the
opportunity to test drive NMatrix &mdash; and SciRuby&#8217;s NMatrix developers a
chance to root out bugs.</p>

<p>Since a gem called ruby-fftw3 already existed to perform FFTW3 operations
on NArray objects, I forked that repository as a starting point. <a href="https://github.com/thisMagpie/fftw">Things are progressing on my Github fork</a> right now.</p>

<p>My mentor for this project is Colin Fuller who is an exceptionally
talented programmer &mdash; and he really knows his git too. He has been a
great help as I adapt to the learning curve of working in C and
Ruby (languages which I am less familiar with than say, Java or
JavaScript).</p>

<p>As I work, I intend to share useful gems of information I gather. Those, in addition to my weekly project updates, will appear right here in this blog so others can hopefully benefit.</p>

<p>I have already posted a few useful bits and bobs on
<a href="http://thismagpie.com">thismagpie.com</a> which relate to my work so far.
I hope to add those to the SciRuby blog, too, provided
the readers are interested in that and time permits. Of course, readers here can feel free to have a browse
of the keywords <a href="http://thismagpie.com/keyword/sciruby">sciruby</a>,
<a href="http://thismagpie.com/keyword/ruby">ruby</a> and
<a href="http://thismagpie.com/keyword/git">git</a> on there for the time being.
I sometimes add posts, manuals and tutorials from external sites where I
find useful ones on the web too, so watch out for these too.</p>

<p>Please, feel free to watch or follow along as the project comes together
and those inclined are welcome to share constructive comments and advice
or raise bugs on the fftw3 issue tracker. Input about my work is very
welcome as the project progresses. This gem is being written for the
community, after all!</p>

<p>You can find me on Twitter (Facebook) or GitHub under the username @thisMagpie.</p>

    <link href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2014/06/02/introducing-gsoc-2014-the-d3-project/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-02T14:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2014/06/02/introducing-gsoc-2014-the-d3-project</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello. I am Naoki, one of four Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2014
students in SciRuby. Let me introduce my project. The goal of the GSoC
2014 D3 Project is to create a new plotting library for
SciRuby. <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> is the most suitable JavaScript
library to achieve this goal.</p>

<p>There are several non-Ruby plotting software libraries in the wild,
like ggplot, matplotlib, and ggplot2. Actually, SciRuby already has
its own plotting libraries named
<a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/plotrb">Plotrb</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/rubyvis">Rubyvis</a>. The main feature of my
project compared with those software packages is <em>interactivity</em>.
Interactivity has various meanings here: interactivity when generating
plots, interactivity when viewing them, and server&ndash;client
interactivity. My project includes all of those.</p>

<p>My project can be divided into two components, one JavaScript and the
other Ruby. JavaScript serves as a back-end, and Ruby as a
front-end. I&#8217;m currently working on the former part. Have a look at a
few examples I&#8217;ve assembled:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://bl.ocks.org/domitry/b8785f02f36deef567ce">Multiple panes</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bl.ocks.org/domitry/2f53781449025f772676">Bar chart</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bl.ocks.org/domitry/e9a914b78f3a576ed3bb">Line</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bl.ocks.org/domitry/308e27d8d12c1374e61f">Scatter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bl.ocks.org/domitry/f215d5ff3bd3f5fec2ad">Another theme</a></li>
</ul>


<p>This project involves a number of challenges, but I believe it to be
achievable during this Summer of Code. Thank you for reading!</p>

    <updated>2014-02-24T21:45:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2014/02/24/gsoc-2014</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re excited to announce that the Ruby Science Foundation has been selected as
a mentoring organization for <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014">Google Summer of Code 2014</a>!</p>

<p>Last year
was our first year as a mentoring organization, and we had a great group of
students working with us on machine learning, timeseries statistics, the
semantic web, and scientific plotting.</p>

<p>This year we&#8217;ve got a super set of
possible projects including more flexible matrix computations, automatic Ruby
interface generation for scientific libraries, a dataframe library for
structuring and manipulating datasets, interactive plotting, a scientific
notebook, high-performance minimization and integration libraries, and a
semantic web datastore backend for scientific computing.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in applying as a student, learning more, or even
contributing independent of GSoC, head over to our <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/sciruby/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2014-Ideas">GSoC 2014 ideas page</a>
to see what projects we think are great.  Don&#8217;t hesitate to tell us if you&#8217;ve
got an amazing idea for a different project, too! If you&#8217;re still left
wondering where to start, check out the <a href="https://github.com/sciruby/nmatrix/issues">issue tracker for NMatrix</a>, the matrix computation
library used as the basis for a number of our projects, and our top priority at
the moment.</p>

    <link href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2014/01/28/gsoc-alumni/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-28T16:07:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2014/01/28/gsoc-alumni</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2013, SciRuby was a mentoring organization for the Google Summer of Code. We
asked our alumni:</p>

<p>1) How did you experience GSoC/SciRuby and what has it brought you?</p>

<p>2) What advice would you give new applicants?</p>

<p>Monica Dragan from Romania worked on <a href="https://github.com/monicadragan/GeneValidator">gene validation</a>, see also her
<a href="http://gene-prediction.blogspot.nl/2013/08/start-using-our-gene-validation-tool.html">blog</a>. Actually, Monica
was part of a different GSoC organisation,
<a href="http://informatics.nescent.org/wiki/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2013">PhyloSoC</a>,
but also participated in our Ruby-centric meetings and code reviews. She shared
her SciRuby GSoC experience:</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Monica:</strong>
During the GSoC period I developed a bioinformatics tool written in Ruby. First of all I learned a new programming
language, as I had no experience with Ruby before. On this GSoC occasion I had the opportunity to get in touch with the
community and I met people passionate about their work, with whom I continued
 the collaboration afterwards. But what I really gained from this experience is that I increased my enthusiasm about
 bioinformatics and I confirmed myself that this is the field I want to focus on in the next years.
</p>


<p>Alberto Arrigoni from Italy worked on <a href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2013/09/24/gsoc-2013-data-mining-in-jruby-with-ruby-band/">data mining and machine learning algorithms for Ruby</a> and shared
his GSoC experience:</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Alberto:</strong>
As a PhD student in the field of bioinformatics, my GSOC experience was very exciting and useful at different levels. On a training level, I had the
unique chance to learn more in depth some topics of machine learning I had
wanted to explore in the past, but never had quite the opportunity or the
resources. On a more technical level, I appreciated the support of the GSOC
mentors and the Sciruby community, which counts numerous experts and a very
active mailing list.
</p>


<p>Ankur Goel from India worked on
<a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/statsample-timeseries">statsample-timeseries</a> for Ruby.
Ankur shared,</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Ankur:</strong>
It was the best learning experience. I learnt quite a lot of statistics while
working on my TimeSeries extension; after GSoC, I picked up Machine Learning
course and I was able to relate it to very easily after working on regression
techniques in GLM extension. I can&#8217;t thank enough for the opportunity provided
and the trust endowed by my mentor on me. Learning to write quality code and
getting reviews was a cherry on cake! 
</p>


<p>Will Strinz from Madison, USA, worked on <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2013/10/12/ruby-and-the-semantic-web-rdf-sparql-publisci/">RDF generators for Ruby</a> for the
semantic web:</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Will:</strong>
GSoC 2013 was a new experience for me in terms of managing my own time,
planning my own project, and keeping up consistent interaction with my mentors
across time zones. Despite a decent amount of prior experience with Ruby, it
was also a challenge and an opportunity for me to really understand the tools
and practices I knew, and learn to use the ones I wasn&#8217;t familiar with.

As for what it&#8217;s brought me, aside from a job I secured partly through skills
and project portfolio I gained during GSoC, and the power of knowing how to do
just about any programming task using Ruby, I learned a lot about how to manage
a project and interact with people in the real world.

Communicating properly and in a timely manner over email and other asynchronous
services is absolutely critical to the work I do now, and a lot harder than
people make it out to be. Staying in touch with my mentors and making sure we
were all on the same page about my project was something I spent a lot of time
on, and in doing so I gained a lot of comfort with the process.

Additionally, GSoC was my first true experience designing a large piece of
software, where I couldn&#8217;t just give up and trash it when the code started
getting messy or confusing. It really forced me to adopt good practices around
testing and organization, especially since I had better programmers than myself
looking over my work.

Software architecture is something you just don&#8217;t learn in college level CS
courses, and by the time I&#8217;d graduated, I&#8217;d started hearing a lot of my CS
professors saying this too. Some day in the future, maybe soon, there will be
classes taught about just this subject, but for now there&#8217;s no better way to
learn about it than by working on a real project, with some accountability and
motivation to actually get it done.


</p>


<p>Our alumni give new GSoC applicants the following advice:</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Monica:</strong>
GSoC is a great experience that you should try as a student! What is cool about GSoC is that you work on the project you are keen on and manage your time as
 you wish. Also, working remotely involves additional challenges. In the end you improve your experience and get to know a lot of new and great people.

</p>




<p class="note"><strong>Alberto:</strong>

I think one of the best features offered by the GSOC is the possibility to
collaborate with (and learn from) people who share the same scientific
interests and have very different backgrounds and skills. Though this may be
somewhat &#8216;expected&#8217; for mentors, I was also lucky to find other GSOC students
willing to bond and share experiences and opinions. My advice is to be
cooperative and try to learn as much as possible from/with them!  

</p>




<p class="note"><strong>Ankur:</strong>
Work really hard. Do your homework before you ask questions or before quoting
anything in proposal. Writing a good proposal is necessary, and you must really
be aware of what you are writing - a good research is necessary. SciRuby
community members are readily available to help you at mailing list and #sciruby channel. A thorough discussion with the mentor will help you out.
</p>




<p class="note"><strong>Will:</strong>
To new applicants this year I&#8217;d stress one thing above all else; get in
touch with people on the sciruby mailing list. Introduce yourself as soon as
possible, and start discussing your project ideas when you have something in
mind. People on the mailing list are very friendly and helpful, so don&#8217;t be
afraid to start a conversation, but also expect constructive criticism of your
proposals.

Answering any questions or concerns promptly and thoroughly not only shows that
your know your stuff and are passionate about your project, it also shows that
you are a good fit for GSoC in general. Don&#8217;t assume you&#8217;re in just because
you&#8217;ve had a good dialogue, but plan and communicate as though you are; don&#8217;t
wait for the project to start to fill in details or contact your prospective
mentors personally.

Once you&#8217;ve submitted a proposal, all of this goes double. The closer you get
to the deadline, the less time there will be to polish your application and
respond to questions, so make sure you&#8217;re doing it quickly and effectively.
</p>


<p>Our SciRuby GSoC alumni added:</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Monica:</strong>
If I don&#8217;t join this year, I wish you good luck with the new students!
</p>




<p class="note"><strong>Ankur:</strong>
I will be happy to sign up again as student, this year!
</p>




<p class="note"><strong>Will:</strong>
I know I&#8217;ve said this already, but GSoC last year was a defining moment in my
path to becoming a software developer, career-wise sure, but more importantly
in the coder vs hacker vs computer scientist vs software developer sense. If
there&#8217;s anything I can do to get involved this year, I&#8217;ll be available.<p>

    <link href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2013/11/07/statistics-with-ruby-time-series-and-general-linear-models/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-07T13:15:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2013/11/07/statistics-with-ruby-time-series-and-general-linear-models</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p class="note"><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong> This is the third of four blog posts detailing our Google Summer of
Code 2013 students&#8217; work, edited by John Woods.</p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/clbustos/statsample/">Statsample</a> is a basic and advanced statistics suite in Ruby. It attempts to
support JRuby and MRI/YARV equally, and also provides pure Ruby implementations for many functions.</p>

<p>Statsample is the perfect library for anyone who is (a) interested in exploring statistical aspects and (b) even a little
familiar (or interested) in Ruby.</p>

<p>It includes a rich API, except for problems involving time series and generalized linear models (GLM), for which the functionality
was rather basic.</p>

<p>So, in this <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013">Google Summer of Code 2013</a> program, working
on the SciRuby Project, I released two extensions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://github.com/ankurgel/statsample-timeseries">Statsample TimeSeries</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AnkurGel/statsample-glm">Statsample GLM</a></li>
</ul>


<p>These gems aim to take Statsample further and incorporate various functionalities and estimation techniques on continuous data.</p>

<h2>Statsample TimeSeries</h2>

<p><a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/statsample-glm"><em>Statsample TimeSeries</em></a> is equipped with a variety of operations, which are directly available on the <code>Series</code> object. A few of those
functionalities are:</p>

<ul>
<li>_<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation">Autocorrelation</a> of series: For finding repeating patterns (like a periodic signal) in noisy data or for
identifying persistence (if it rained today, will it rain tomorrow?).</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_moving_average_model">Autoregressive and Moving Average</a>: Autoregressive
models (AR and ARMA) are useful for describing random processes such as found in nature and economics believed to be
predictable from past behavior (e.g., El Niño, the stock market).</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_autocorrelation_function">Partial autocorrelation</a>
with Yule&ndash;Walker, a method for calculating the coefficients of autoregressive models.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levinson_recursion">Levinson&ndash;Durbin</a> estimation: for <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/dsp/ref/levinsondurbin.html">solving linear equations</a>
involving a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toeplitz_matrix">Toeplitz matrix</a>, such as in signal processing or cyclic signals.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter">Kalman filtering</a> (or linear quadratic estimation): often used for
determining position and motion of a moving object based on sensor information (e.g., for drawing a vehicle&#8217;s position
on a map using GPS data, or for aircraft or spacecraft navigation based on sensor inputs)</li>
<li>Moving averages, differences and autocovariances.</li>
</ul>


<p>To get your hands dirty,</p>

<ul>
<li> Install Statsample with <code>gem install statsample</code>.</li>
<li> Next, install the TimeSeries extension with <code>gem install statsample-timeseries</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, let&#8217;s make a simple <code>TimeSeries</code> object:</p>

<p>You can go through the <a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/statsample-timeseries/0.0.3/frames">documentation and API for more information</a>.</p>

<h2>Statsample GLM</h2>

<p><a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/statsample-glm"><em>Statsample GLM</em></a> includes many helpful regression techniques, which can be used for regression analysis on data.
Some of those techniques are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression">Poisson Regression</a>: used to model contingency tables and counts</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">Logistic Regression</a>: among other things, predicts patient outcomes in medicine based on
categorical data (age, test results, etc.); and predicts how someone will vote in an election using demographic information</li>
<li>Exponential Regression: one case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_regression">nonlinear regression</a> (examples
might include the <a href="http://mathbits.com/MathBits/TISection/Statistics2/exponential.htm">temperature of a cup of coffee</a> left
in a cold room, or the decay of an orbit)</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteratively_reweighted_least_squares">Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares</a>: used to
mitigate the effects of outliers</li>
</ul>


<p>The top level module for regression techniques is <code>Statsample::Regression</code>.</p>

<p>Using it is as simple as ever:</p>

<pre><code>  * First, install `statsample` by `gem install statsample`.
  * Then, install GLM by `gem install `statsample-glm`.
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/statsample-glm/Statsample/Regression">documentation and API details is available here</a></p>

<p>We have some more plans for GLM module. First in the list is to make the algorithms work with singular value decomposition,
because manual inversion of matrices is not fun for larger values in a Poisson regression.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I have <a href="http://ankurgoel.com">blogged about most of the functionalities</a>; additional information is available there.</p>

<p>Please explore and use the libraries; I eagerly await your input, suggestions and questions. Feel free to leave
any questions on <a href="http://github.com/SciRuby/statsample-glm/issues">the Statsample GLM tracker</a> or
<a href="[the%20Statsample%20GLM%20tracker](http://github.com/SciRuby/statsample-glm/issues">the Statsample TimeSeries tracker</a>.</p>

<p>I had an amazing summer!</p>

<p>Stay tuned and Enjoy.</p>

    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2013/11/01/call-for-funding-more-women-needed-in-open-source-science-software</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ncwit.org/blog/did-you-know-demographics-technical-women">Women make up 51% of the American workforce, and yet only 20% of software engineers are female.</a> Worldwide,
the situation is similar. <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/58218">In open source software engineering, the statistics are worse: only 1.5&ndash;5% are female.</a></p>

<p>One of the organizations which presented at the Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit was the <a href="http://gnome.org/opw/">GNOME Foundation&#8217;s Outreach Program for Women</a> (OPW). OPW is
similar to GSoC, except that OPW doesn&#8217;t require its applicants to be
students &mdash; or know how to program when the coding period begins. The pay is competitive with GSoC. And of course,
only women can apply.</p>

<p>In the process of our Google Code-In 2013 application, I recruited several female mentors to work with female GCI
students &mdash; not a requirement, but I think it helps to have supportive people involved with whom one can identify. Unfortunately,
we weren&#8217;t selected for the Code-In (not too disappointing given <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gci-announce/P73dzsxKdsM">the several venerable and accomplished organizations that were chosen</a>). But we want to have another go, this
time by applying for the Outreach Program for Women.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s where we need your help.</p>

<p>Work for a company that might want to support this goal? Show this to your boss. Have him or her get in touch with
us (sciruby.project at gmail dot com).</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t work for such a company, but would still like to help, you can also get in touch at the same email address.
As a general rule of thumb, <a href="https://pledgie.com/campaigns/15783">you can always donate via Pledgie</a>, even if you don&#8217;t
have access to tons of money.</p>

<p>By the way, <a href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2013/10/25/mentoring-future-computational-power-women-for-gci-2013/">here&#8217;s a blog post by one of our mentors, Anna Belak</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My name is Anna, and I&#8217;m an engineer and a scientist. I study Materials Science and Engineering at the University of
Michigan; and I graduated from Virginia Tech with a degree in Physics. My thesis project deals with computationally
predicting the properties of materials used in lithium-ion batteries and airplane turbine blades.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m writing this blog post for SciRuby, but I&#8217;m really writing it for the young women out there. SciRuby is applying to
participate in <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/">Google&#8217;s Code-In 2013</a>, which aims to get high school
students involved in the open source movement, and specifically in coding. It&#8217;s great preparation for college and
beyond — whatever you might choose to study.</p>

<p>I became involved in science because I love figuring stuff out and working with smart, interesting people, and I want
you to get involved, too. Modern science wouldn&#8217;t be possible without open source software. Moreover, if you learn how
to code, you&#8217;ll always have a job. Always.</p>

<p>And the cool part is that you don&#8217;t have to know how to code in order to participate. Many of the tasks involve research
and documentation in science and mathematics — which is a great way to obtain valuable experience for college
applications.</p>

Code 2013 students&#8217; work. I edited it to include a very incomplete list of public RDF repositories. &mdash;John Woods</p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Across all fields and disciplines, contemporary scientists are faced with a massive and growing volume of data. It often
won&#8217;t fit in a lab notebook, and there is a pressing need to share it more quickly and widely than publication in a
journal article would allow for. Database software is one great solution for storage of such data, but relational
databases become brittle in the face of changes or new information, do not play nicely with other databases or data
derived from such databases, and may not be fully machine (or human) readable without pre-existing knowledge.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Internet is an extremely useful place to discover and share useful information, but it is essentially
built around linked documents, rather than pure data, and so our primary mechanism for sharing data is as HTML or text.</p>

<p>RDF and related technologies propose to provide the means to move beyond a web of documents to a web of data. Along
the way, these technologies may address many of the problems with conventional relational databases (e.g., SQL). At its
core, RDF defines an extremely flexible method for representing data on the web &mdash; which is nonetheless
unambiguously defined, without any external context, and can be linked to other data as web documents link to each
other. Because RDF data can be understood as either a set of subject&ndash;predicate&ndash;object statements or a
directed graph with labeled edges, a number of supporting standards and tools that have grown up around it to provide
powerful storage and access methods that are often easier to implement and use than those associated with relational
databases and the document-based web.</p>

<h2>Enter PubliSci</h2>

<p>This summer I created a Ruby gem, <a href="http://github.com/sciruby/publisci">PubliSci</a>, to facilitate data publication and interaction using
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_web">Semantic Web</a>. The format offers a unified way to share and combine
information from multiple sources, support for machine learning tools,
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL">flexible query language</a> that makes application integration easy, and the
backing of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and other standards-setting bodies.</p>

<p>The PubliSci gem comprises a set of parsers for converting various input formats using
the <a href="http://semanticweb.com/w3c-publishes-last-call-working-drafts-for-rdf-data-cube-dcat_b35950">RDF Data Cube vocabulary</a>, and
a Ruby interface for defining new ones. Since the relationship between external datasets and semantic web formats is
sometimes up to interpretation, a domain-specific language is included to allow end users to resolve ambiguities and
provide additional metadata.</p>

<p>Along with the conversion tool, a standalone server is available as an extension to the gem that simplifies setting up and interacting
with RDF data stores. The server allows import, export, querying, and management of external <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore">triplestores</a> such as
<a href="http://4store.org/">4store</a>, and supports both cross-domain access and content negotiation so the gem can be accessed
using Javascript or other applications.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Triplestores</strong> are databases for the storage and retrieval of <strong>triples</strong>,
which are typically subject&ndash;object&ndash;predicate relationships (e.g., <i>Bob knows Fred</i>).</p>


<p>If you&#8217;d like to contribute, the <a href="https://github.com/sciruby/publisci">source code is available on Github</a>, and <a href="http://gsocsemantic.wordpress.com/2013/08/05/bio-publisci/">a broad
outline of the to do list can be had as well</a>.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve done <code>gem install publisci</code>, you can require the gem in the normal way (<code>require 'publisci'</code>). To invoke the
domain-specific language, you&#8217;ll also want to include the <code>DSL</code> module:</p>

<pre><code>require 'publisci'
include PubliSci::DSL
</code></pre>

<p>Input data can be specified like so:</p>

<pre><code># Specify input data
data do
  # Use local or remote paths to point to the data file you want to load:
  source 'https://github.com/wstrinz/publisci/raw/master/spec/csv/bacon.csv'

  # Specify datacube properties.
  dimension 'producer', 'pricerange'
  measure 'chunkiness'

  # Set parser-specific options.
  option 'label_column', 'producer'
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can provide meta-data on your dataset as well.</p>

<pre><code>metadata do
  dataset 'bacon'
  title 'Bacon dataset'
  creator 'Will Strinz'
  description 'some data about bacon'
  date '1-10-2010'
end
</code></pre>

<p>Sending the data to a repository is simple.</p>

<pre><code># Send output to an RDF::Repository
#  can also use 'generate_n3' to output a turtle string
repo = to_repository
</code></pre>

<p>SPARQL queries can be run on the dataset using the <code>QueryHelper</code> module.</p>

<pre><code># run SPARQL queries on the dataset
PubliSci::QueryHelper.execute('select * where {?s ?p ?o} limit 5', repo)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, data can be exported in other formats, such as ARFF:</p>

<pre><code># export in other formats
PubliSci::Writers::ARFF.new.from_store(repo)
</code></pre>

<h2>Some places to look for RDF repositories</h2>

    <link href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2013/09/24/gsoc-2013-data-mining-in-jruby-with-ruby-band/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-24T10:44:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2013/09/24/gsoc-2013-data-mining-in-jruby-with-ruby-band</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p class="note"><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong> This is the first of four blog posts detailing
our Google Summer of Code 2013 students&#8217; work, edited by John Woods.</p>


<p>In the context of the Google Summer of Code 2013, I have developed a Ruby gem called <a href="https://github.com/arrigonialberto86/ruby-band">Ruby Band</a>
that makes some selected Java software for data mining and machine learning applications available to the JRuby/Ruby
users. This project complements existing software already developed for SciRuby by adding support for the Weka Toolkit
and general functions included in the Apache Commons Math library.</p>

<p>As Weka does, Ruby Band features a comprehensive collection of data preprocessing and modeling techniques, and supports
several standard data mining tasks, more specifically: data pre-processing (filtering), clustering, classification,
regression, and feature selection.</p>

<p>All of Ruby Band&#8217;s techniques have been built on the assumption that the data is
available as a single flat file or relation, where each datum is described by a fixed number of attributes. The
loaded datasets are stored in Weka Instances objects, which are used as &#8216;core&#8217; data types for the interactions with
other software (Apache Commons Math) or platforms.</p>

<p>Originally, Ruby Band was called Ruby Mining. I renamed it Ruby Band, as I imagine
different software sources (Weka, Apache, etc.) working as a whole, like in a real band. Ruby Band has been designed
with a modular structure, so that it can be easily extended and integrated with other Java software. The Core module is
allows data types from different sources to be defined and integrated using converter methods;
functionalities from each piece of additional software are independently imported. This structure increases the
extensibility of the product, as in the future other developers may add functionalities according to their needs.</p>

<p>Though Ruby Band provides full support for the greatest part of the Weka APIs, some topics still need to be addressed
properly. As I coded, I utilized the Weka Java APIs documentation as my roadmap; if you want to contribute,
<a href="http://weka.wikispaces.com/Use+WEKA+in+your+Java+code">go see what is still missing</a>. The best and easiest way
to introduce a new functionality into the Ruby Band framework is to write up a pertinent Cucumber test, as a number of
Weka recipes have been posted online by the creators.</p>

<p>The beta version of Ruby Band has already been released for general use on Rubygems (<code>gem install ruby-band</code>).</p>

<p>This is a quick example of how to train a classifier on a dataset parsed from an ARFF file:</p>

<pre><code>require 'ruby-band'

# parse a dataset
dataset = Core::Parser.parse_ARFF(my_file.arff)

# initialize and train a classifier
classifier = Weka::Classifier::Lazy::KStar::Base.new do
  set_options '-M d'
  set_data dataset
  set_class_index 4
end

# cross-validate the trained classifier
puts classifier.cross_validate(3)
</code></pre>

    <link href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2013/09/18/nmatrix-nearing-beta-release/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-18T15:18:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2013/09/18/nmatrix-nearing-beta-release</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As of this writing, NMatrix v0.0.9 is available on RubyGems. It is likely that the next version will be a beta release
candidate, as there&#8217;s only one critical feature still missing (<code>==</code> between matrices of different storage types).</p>

<p>An enormous amount has changed since my last entry.</p>

<h2>New, friendlier constructor</h2>

<p>First and foremost, NMatrix sports a new constructor, based
on <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sciruby-dev/tPwnmPbRR_U/PL0Nc92gdzEJ">helpful comments from folks on the listserv</a>. Here
are some examples of construction:</p>

<pre><code>NMatrix.new([4,4], 0) # 4x4 dense matrix of :int32, all 0
NMatrix.new([4,4], 0.0) # 4x4 dense matrix of :float64, all 0.0
NMatrix.new([4,4], 0.0, dtype: :complex64) # 4x4 dense matrix of :complex64
NMatrix.new([1,4], stype: :yale) # size 4 sparse (Yale) row vector of 0s
NMatrix.new([4,3], [0,1,2]) # 4 rows, 3 columns: gradient across each row from 0 to 2 (int32)
NMatrix.new([4,3], [0,1,2], stype: :yale, default: 0) # same as above, but Yale storage (int32)
NMatrix.new([4,1], stype: :list, dtype: :rational128) # size 4 sparse (list) column vector of rational 0s
NMatrix.new([4,4]) # 4x4 dense matrix containing nils
NMatrix.new([4,4], dtype: :int64) # 4x4 uninitialized dense matrix containing 64-bit integers
NMatrix.new(4)     # same as above
</code></pre>

<p>The different storage types (stypes) have slightly different behaviors when no initialization value is provided. This
may change in the future, but addresses the somewhat different use-cases of these storage types.</p>

<p>I show a variety of examples above, several of which are not particularly wise uses &#8212; for example, the <code>[0,1,2]</code> Yale
gradient, which uses 32-bit integers and must store 11 column indices and pointers (which are most likely unsigned
long integers) in addition to the 11 entries (4 for the always-stored diagonal, 1 for the default, and 6 for the
non-diagonal non-zeros).</p>

<p>The key to understanding the differing construction is the default value. All sparse matrices need a default. Usually we
think of sparse matrices as being zero-based (only non-zero values are stored), but NMatrix now allows other defaults.
However, dense matrices don&#8217;t need defaults, and in fact sometimes it&#8217;s more efficient to allocate them without
initializing them &#8212; such as if they&#8217;re about to store the results of some LAPACK function call. But if they contain
Ruby objects, they <strong>have</strong> to be initialized, which is why they become nil.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re still working out a few bugs in construction. If you find any, please report them in our <a href="http://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/issues">issue tracker</a>.</p>

<h2>Elimination of NVectors</h2>

<p>We removed the NVector class. Frankly, it didn&#8217;t make sense. A vector can&#8217;t have an orientation unless it has multiple
dimensions &#8212; even if some of those dimensions have length 1. Now, vectors and matrices are treated the same in the code.</p>

<p>The good news is that element access (<code>[]</code>) has been rewritten so that the programmer only needs provide the coordinates
whose dimensions are not 1. For example:</p>

<pre><code>n = NMatrix.new([4,1,3], 0) # 3-dimensional matrix of 0s
n[2,1] == n[2,0,1]
=&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>The same rule applies to slicing.</p>

<h2>Slicing improvements</h2>

<p>Aleksey Timin contributed the framework for matrix slicing. Matrices can be sliced by copying or by reference. Modifying
a copy-slice does not modify the original matrix; but modifying a reference slice does.</p>

<p>A copy of some portion of the matrix may be made using <code>NMatrix#slice</code>:</p>

<pre><code>new_matrix = n.slice(0..1,0..2)
</code></pre>

<p>And what appears to be a copy, but is actually a reference, may be made using brackets:</p>

<pre><code>ref = n[0..1,0..2]
</code></pre>

<p>Reference slices may also be modified in a variety of ways:</p>

<pre><code>n[0..4,2..8] = 0   # change all entries to 0
n[0..4,2..8] = [0,1,2]  # change the selected entries to [0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2...]
n[0..4,2..8] = NMatrix.new([3,3], [0,1,2]) # same as above
</code></pre>

<p>For the sake of speed, each of these <code>[]=</code> returns the right-hand value, whether that value is an array, matrix, or
single value. So, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>x = m[0..4,2..8] = n[0..1,0..2] = [1,2,3]
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>x</code> will be equal to <code>[1,2,3]</code> after the evaluation.</p>

<h2>Iteration</h2>

<p>Matrices are now enumerable. There are a variety of enumerators &#8212; namely <code>each_with_indices</code> (and <code>each</code>), <code>each_stored_with_indices</code>,
and <code>each_ordered_stored_with_indices</code>. The first, <code>each</code>, is guaranteed to produce the same iteration regardless of the
storage type. The other two iterate only across the stored entries.</p>

<h2>Elementwise comparisons</h2>

<p>A regular matrix comparison, returning a single boolean, can be accomplished using <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code>. In earlier versions of
NMatrix, the results of the element-wise versions, <code>=~</code>, <code>!~</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, and <code>&lt;=</code>, were matrices of 0s and 1s,
stored using the <code>:byte</code> dtype.</p>

<p>Now, these comparisons return matrices of Ruby objects:</p>

<pre><code>n &lt; m
=&gt; [ true,  false, false, true,
     false, false, false, true,
     true,  true,  true,  true  ]
</code></pre>

<p>Try experimenting with sparse matrices to see how the default value (<code>#default_value</code>) is initialized on the result during an
elementwise comparison.</p>

<h2>Chunky bacon</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m really excited about all of the chunky bacon in our latest release. I feel like things are really coming together
for our library. I&#8217;m also glad to see that people are using it.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of using NMatrix yourself, I strongly encourage it. Although I&#8217;m writing my dissertation, I plan to
prioritize troubleshooting ahead of just about everything else. I want using NMatrix to be an easy choice for every
Rubyist.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

    <link href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2012/12/07/how-to-use-nmatrix-shortcuts/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-07T12:30:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2012/12/07/how-to-use-nmatrix-shortcuts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> This code predates v0.0.9 alpha, which is when the NMatrix constructor changed. Please check the <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/wiki/Getting-started#shortcuts">NMatrix Getting Started guide</a> for the most recent information.</p>


<p>John Woods <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/commit/2b480ce0985affc7218fc341fcb4e5024b30545b">merged my last pull request to NMatrix</a> recently and I wanted to write about why we created these shortcuts and what can be done with them. <!--more--></p>

<h2>The need for shortcuts</h2>

<p>The first iteration of NMatrix shortcuts was written by <a href="https://github.com/dcarrera">Daniel Carrera</a> and sent to the mailing list, where I started working with them. Some discussions, decisions and two pull requests later, we have a working set of methods to create common matrices (<code>zeros</code>, <code>ones</code>, <code>random</code>, etc) and do some cool stuff (<code>column</code> and <code>linspace</code>) very easily.</p>

<p>There are at least two good reasons to have these shortcuts: MATLAB users are going to feel at home, and the shortcuts allow us to prototype and experiment more rapidly. For example, it&#8217;s dead simple to create an identify matrix when you need one:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; require 'nmatrix'

&gt;&gt; matrix = NMatrix.identity(3) # 3x3
=&gt; #&lt;NMatrix:0x007faa5b8cda40shape:[3,3] dtype:float64 stype:dense&gt; 
&gt;&gt; matrix.pp

# [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
# [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
# [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
</code></pre>

<p>And a random matrix to test some operation:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; rand_matrix = NMatrix.random(4) # 4x4
=&gt; #&lt;NMatrix:0x007faa5b01cdd8shape:[4,4] dtype:float64 stype:dense&gt;
&gt;&gt; rand_matrix.pp

# [0.5933103148378577, 0.8556103970281977, 0.7176768395610358, 0.07160353964395305]
# [0.8566365570076784, 0.33925854948960343, 0.5994298479703805, 0.6906794137948586]
# [0.5684593743073485, 0.10273166792035393, 0.46187577773882293, 0.586085963973687]
# [0.8944982538369494, 0.9896291945923837, 0.8787034784673503, 0.5933103148378577]
</code></pre>

<h2>Shortcuts available</h2>

<p>The following list is taken from <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/wiki/NMatrix">NMatrix&#8217;s wiki</a>. All are class methods on <code>NMatrix</code>.</p>

<pre><code>ones(3,3)                    # A 3x3 matrix of ones.
zeros(4,4) or zeroes(4,4)    # Creates a matrix of zeros with dimensions as parameters.
identity(5,5) or eye(5,5)    # A 5x5 identity matrix. Only works with NMatrix.
seq(8)                       # An 8-vector with a sequence of values from 0 to 7.
random(6,6)                  # A 6x6 matrix of random values between 0 and 1.

column(2)                    # Return the 2nd column of the original matrix. Only works with NMatrix.

indgen(8)                    # To make IDL users happy. Same as `seq(8, :int32)`.
findgen(8)                   # Same as `seq(8, :float32)`.
bindgen(8)                   # Same as `seq(8, :byte)`.
cindgen(8)                   # Same as `seq(8, :complex64)`.

linspace(0, pi, 100)         # A vector of 100 values from 0 to pi, inclusive. Only works with NVector.
</code></pre>

<p>The method names are mostly from MATLAB. In the future, when more functionality is added, we&#8217;ll try to create a more &#8220;Ruby-like&#8221; feel to the API. But as these shortcuts do very primitive tasks, there isn&#8217;t any obvious room for improvement. (Feel free to prove us wrong, however!)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll create a separate wiki page for the shortcuts to be able to organize and put more information about how to use them. But I want to create a better RDoc documentation for NMatrix — so the full API will probably be referenced there. I&#8217;ll write a new blog post here when something along these lines is done.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>First, let&#8217;s try normalizing the columns of an NMatrix.</p>

<pre><code>require 'nmatrix'

m = NMatrix.seq(3, :float32)
m.pp

# [0.0, 1.0, 2.0]
# [3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
# [6.0, 7.0, 8.0]

(0 .. m.shape[1] - 1).each do |j|
  col = m.column(j)
    norm = Math.sqrt(col.transpose.dot(col)[0, 0])
    (0 .. m.shape[0] - 1).each { |i| m[i,j] /= norm }
end

m.pp

# [0.0, 0.12309148907661438, 0.20739033818244934]
# [0.4472135901451111, 0.4923659563064575, 0.5184758305549622]
# [0.8944271802902222, 0.861640453338623, 0.8295613527297974]

(0 .. m.shape[1] - 1).each do |j|
  col = m.column(j)
  puts Math.sqrt(col.transpose.dot(col)[0,0])
end

# 0.9999999701976772
# 1.0
# 1.0
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, slice by reference isn&#8217;t working on <code>HEAD</code>, or we could make a few additional improvements (see issue <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/issues/51">#51</a>).</p>

<p>The other thing that I&#8217;ve wanted to do is to use <code>linspace</code> to generate points for plotting sines, cosines, etc. Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>require 'nmatrix'

vector = NVector.linspace(0, Math::PI, 10)
vector.pretty_print

# 0.0
# 0.3490658503988659
# 0.6981317007977318
# 1.0471975511965976
# 1.3962634015954636
# 1.7453292519943295
# 2.0943951023931953
# 2.443460952792061
# 2.792526803190927
# 3.141592653589793

10.times do |i|
  vector[k, 0] = Math::sin(vector[k, 0])
end

vector.pretty_print

# 0.0
# 0.3420201433256687
# 0.6427876096865393
# 0.8660254037844386
# 0.984807753012208
# 0.984807753012208
# 0.8660254037844388
# 0.6427876096865395
# 0.3420201433256689
# 1.2246467991473532e-16
</code></pre>

<p>These results show a happy result, in that we are able to use NMatrix for simple tasks already. Of course, there are problems to be solved, e.g. slice by reference, inversion for all dtypes, eigenvalues. But it&#8217;s going somewhere, it&#8217;s growing.</p>

<p>I hope that by this time next year we&#8217;ll have a very mature linear algebra library (and much more).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week we selected three excellent candidates for <a href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2012/09/24/sciruby-receives-ruby-association-grant--fellowships-available/">SciRuby fellowships</a>. We were incredibly pleased to be able to offer so many fellowships, made possible in part by the generosity of an anonymous contributor. <!--more--></p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/agarie">Carlos Agarie</a> will be working half-time starting immediately on providing certain critical functionality to NMatrix and on improving our documentation. Specifically, matrix inversions and determinant calculations both depend upon BLAS, and in some cases CLAPACK. However, the CLAPACK interface is unavailable to most Mac users; and neither BLAS nor LAPACK provides rational support, which is on the NMatrix roadmap. Carlos is a Brazilian exchange student at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/masaomi">Masaomi &#8220;Masa&#8221; Hatakeyama</a> is a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Zurich. He is devoting ten hours per week initially to adding NMatrix support to Ruby/GSL, while also improving the NMatrix unit tests. His work is critical to interoperability between NMatrix and the other SciRuby projects.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="http://github.com/ryanmt">Ryan Taylor</a> is a biochemistry doctoral candidate at Brigham Young University in the United States. Ryan will be working full-time starting in January on NMatrix, and plans to contribute functionality essential to any matrix library&#8212;such as factorizations and decompositions; computations of trace, exponentials, square roots, norms, and tensors; basic statistics; transforms; and solvers.</p>

<p>We also want to take a moment to thank <a href="http://www.symora.com">Symora Networks</a> for its assistance. Specifically, the size of the Ruby Association grant is such that the U.S. requires us to apply for tax status, a somewhat expensive process for an open source project. Symora is providing the bulk of the money required for that application. Thanks also go to our many individual donors, who are just as necessary to this process.</p>

<p>And of course, none of this would be possible without the Ruby Association. They provided us not only with financial resources to grow our project, but also with an endorsement of our vision: Ruby needs scientific packages in order to grow as a language.</p>

    <link href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2012/09/24/second-nmatrix-alpha-released/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-24T14:12:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2012/09/24/second-nmatrix-alpha-released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Friday, we released the somewhat overdue second alpha of <a href="http://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix">NMatrix</a>, version 0.0.2.</p>

<p>This second alpha has boasts a significantly improved and much more maintainable code base, thanks to our Summer 2012
 SciRuby Fellow, <a href="https://github.com/chriswailes">Chris Wailes</a>, and sponsoring organization <a href="http://brighterplanet.com">Brighter Planet</a>. <!--more--></p>

<p>The library has been almost completely rewritten in C++, with API available for both C and C++.</p>

<p>It also includes basic slicing support for dense and list matrices and dense LU decomposition.</p>

<p>Check it out and let us know what you think! Remember to look in the <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/issues?direction=desc&amp;sort=created&amp;state=open">issue tracker</a>
 if you have any problems.</p>

<p>Finally, if you&#8217;re a student, you should consider applying to be a <a href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2012/09/24/sciruby-receives-ruby-association-grant--fellowships-available/">SciRuby Fellow</a> this winter or spring.</p>
