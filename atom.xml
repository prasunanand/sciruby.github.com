    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ncwit.org/blog/did-you-know-demographics-technical-women">Women make up 51% of the American workforce, and yet only 20% of software engineers are female.</a> Worldwide,
the situation is similar. <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/58218">In open source software engineering, the statistics are worse: only 1.5&ndash;5% are female.</a></p>

<p>One of the organizations which presented at the Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit was the <a href="http://gnome.org/opw/">GNOME Foundation&#8217;s Outreach Program for Women</a> (OPW). OPW is
similar to GSoC, except that OPW doesn&#8217;t require its applicants to be
students &mdash; or know how to program when the coding period begins. The pay is competitive with GSoC. And of course,
only women can apply.</p>

<p>In the process of our Google Code-In 2013 application, I recruited several female mentors to work with female GCI
students &mdash; not a requirement, but I think it helps to have supportive people involved with whom one can identify. Unfortunately,
we weren&#8217;t selected for the Code-In (not too disappointing given <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gci-announce/P73dzsxKdsM">the several venerable and accomplished organizations that were chosen</a>). But we want to have another go, this
time by applying for the Outreach Program for Women.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s where we need your help.</p>

<p>Work for a company that might want to support this goal? Show this to your boss. Have him or her get in touch with
us (sciruby.project at gmail dot com).</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t work for such a company, but would still like to help, you can also get in touch at the same email address.
As a general rule of thumb, <a href="https://pledgie.com/campaigns/15783">you can always donate via Pledgie</a>, even if you don&#8217;t
have access to tons of money.</p>

<p>By the way, <a href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2013/10/25/mentoring-future-computational-power-women-for-gci-2013/">here&#8217;s a blog post by one of our mentors, Anna Belak</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m writing this blog post for SciRuby, but I&#8217;m really writing it for the young women out there. SciRuby is applying to
participate in <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/">Google&#8217;s Code-In 2013</a>, which aims to get high school
students involved in the open source movement, and specifically in coding. It&#8217;s great preparation for college and
beyond — whatever you might choose to study.</p>

<p>I became involved in science because I love figuring stuff out and working with smart, interesting people, and I want
you to get involved, too. Modern science wouldn&#8217;t be possible without open source software. Moreover, if you learn how
to code, you&#8217;ll always have a job. Always.</p>

<p>And the cool part is that you don&#8217;t have to know how to code in order to participate. Many of the tasks involve research
and documentation in science and mathematics — which is a great way to obtain valuable experience for college
applications.</p>

    <link href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2013/10/12/ruby-and-the-semantic-web-rdf-sparql-publisci/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-12T16:36:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2013/10/12/ruby-and-the-semantic-web-rdf-sparql-publisci</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p class="note"><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong> This is the second of four blog posts detailing our Google Summer of
Code 2013 students&#8217; work. I edited it to include a very incomplete list of public RDF repositories. &mdash;John Woods</p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Across all fields and disciplines, contemporary scientists are faced with a massive and growing volume of data. It often
won&#8217;t fit in a lab notebook, and there is a pressing need to share it more quickly and widely than publication in a
journal article would allow for. Database software is one great solution for storage of such data, but relational
databases become brittle in the face of changes or new information, do not play nicely with other databases or data
derived from such databases, and may not be fully machine (or human) readable without pre-existing knowledge.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Internet is an extremely useful place to discover and share useful information, but it is essentially
built around linked documents, rather than pure data, and so our primary mechanism for sharing data is as HTML or text.</p>

<p>RDF and related technologies propose to provide the means to move beyond a web of documents to a web of data. Along
the way, these technologies may address many of the problems with conventional relational databases (e.g., SQL). At its
core, RDF defines an extremely flexible method for representing data on the web &mdash; which is nonetheless
unambiguously defined, without any external context, and can be linked to other data as web documents link to each
other. Because RDF data can be understood as either a set of subject&ndash;predicate&ndash;object statements or a
directed graph with labeled edges, a number of supporting standards and tools that have grown up around it to provide
powerful storage and access methods that are often easier to implement and use than those associated with relational
databases and the document-based web.</p>

<h2>Enter PubliSci</h2>

<p>This summer I created a Ruby gem, <a href="http://github.com/sciruby/publisci">PubliSci</a>, to facilitate data publication and interaction using
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_web">Semantic Web</a>. The format offers a unified way to share and combine
information from multiple sources, support for machine learning tools,
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL">flexible query language</a> that makes application integration easy, and the
backing of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and other standards-setting bodies.</p>

<p>The PubliSci gem comprises a set of parsers for converting various input formats using
the <a href="http://semanticweb.com/w3c-publishes-last-call-working-drafts-for-rdf-data-cube-dcat_b35950">RDF Data Cube vocabulary</a>, and
a Ruby interface for defining new ones. Since the relationship between external datasets and semantic web formats is
sometimes up to interpretation, a domain-specific language is included to allow end users to resolve ambiguities and
provide additional metadata.</p>

<p>Along with the conversion tool, a standalone server is available as an extension to the gem that simplifies setting up and interacting
with RDF data stores. The server allows import, export, querying, and management of external <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore">triplestores</a> such as
<a href="http://4store.org/">4store</a>, and supports both cross-domain access and content negotiation so the gem can be accessed
using Javascript or other applications.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Triplestores</strong> are databases for the storage and retrieval of <strong>triples</strong>,
which are typically subject&ndash;object&ndash;predicate relationships (e.g., <i>Bob knows Fred</i>).</p>


<p>If you&#8217;d like to contribute, the <a href="https://github.com/sciruby/publisci">source code is available on Github</a>, and <a href="http://gsocsemantic.wordpress.com/2013/08/05/bio-publisci/">a broad
outline of the to do list can be had as well</a>.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve done <code>gem install publisci</code>, you can require the gem in the normal way (<code>require 'publisci'</code>). To invoke the
domain-specific language, you&#8217;ll also want to include the <code>DSL</code> module:</p>

<pre><code>require 'publisci'
include PubliSci::DSL
</code></pre>

<p>Input data can be specified like so:</p>

<pre><code># Specify input data
data do
  # Use local or remote paths to point to the data file you want to load:
  source 'https://github.com/wstrinz/publisci/raw/master/spec/csv/bacon.csv'

  # Specify datacube properties.
  dimension 'producer', 'pricerange'
  measure 'chunkiness'

  # Set parser-specific options.
  option 'label_column', 'producer'
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can provide meta-data on your dataset as well.</p>

<pre><code>metadata do
  dataset 'bacon'
  title 'Bacon dataset'
  creator 'Will Strinz'
  description 'some data about bacon'
  date '1-10-2010'
end
</code></pre>

<p>Sending the data to a repository is simple.</p>

<pre><code># Send output to an RDF::Repository
#  can also use 'generate_n3' to output a turtle string
repo = to_repository
</code></pre>

<p>SPARQL queries can be run on the dataset using the <code>QueryHelper</code> module.</p>

<pre><code># run SPARQL queries on the dataset
PubliSci::QueryHelper.execute('select * where {?s ?p ?o} limit 5', repo)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, data can be exported in other formats, such as ARFF:</p>

<pre><code># export in other formats
PubliSci::Writers::ARFF.new.from_store(repo)
</code></pre>

<h2>Some places to look for RDF repositories</h2>

<ul>

    <link href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2013/09/24/gsoc-2013-data-mining-in-jruby-with-ruby-band/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-24T10:44:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2013/09/24/gsoc-2013-data-mining-in-jruby-with-ruby-band</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p class="note"><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong> This is the first of four blog posts detailing
our Google Summer of Code 2013 students&#8217; work.</p>


<p>In the context of the Google Summer of Code 2013, I have developed a Ruby gem called <a href="https://github.com/arrigonialberto86/ruby-band">Ruby Band</a>
that makes some selected Java software for data mining and machine learning applications available to the JRuby/Ruby
users. This project complements existing software already developed for SciRuby by adding support for the Weka Toolkit
and general functions included in the Apache Commons Math library.</p>

<p>As Weka does, Ruby Band features a comprehensive collection of data preprocessing and modeling techniques, and supports
several standard data mining tasks, more specifically: data pre-processing (filtering), clustering, classification,
regression, and feature selection.</p>

<p>All of Ruby Band&#8217;s techniques have been built on the assumption that the data is
available as a single flat file or relation, where each datum is described by a fixed number of attributes. The
loaded datasets are stored in Weka Instances objects, which are used as &#8216;core&#8217; data types for the interactions with
other software (Apache Commons Math) or platforms.</p>

<p>Originally, Ruby Band was called Ruby Mining. I renamed it Ruby Band, as I imagine
different software sources (Weka, Apache, etc.) working as a whole, like in a real band. Ruby Band has been designed
with a modular structure, so that it can be easily extended and integrated with other Java software. The Core module is
allows data types from different sources to be defined and integrated using converter methods;
functionalities from each piece of additional software are independently imported. This structure increases the
extensibility of the product, as in the future other developers may add functionalities according to their needs.</p>

<p>Though Ruby Band provides full support for the greatest part of the Weka APIs, some topics still need to be addressed
properly. As I coded, I utilized the Weka Java APIs documentation as my roadmap; if you want to contribute,
<a href="http://weka.wikispaces.com/Use+WEKA+in+your+Java+code">go see what is still missing</a>. The best and easiest way
to introduce a new functionality into the Ruby Band framework is to write up a pertinent Cucumber test, as a number of
Weka recipes have been posted online by the creators.</p>

<p>The beta version of Ruby Band has already been released for general use on Rubygems (<code>gem install ruby-band</code>).</p>

<p>This is a quick example of how to train a classifier on a dataset parsed from an ARFF file:</p>

<pre><code>require 'ruby-band'

# parse a dataset
dataset = Core::Parser.parse_ARFF(my_file.arff)

# initialize and train a classifier
classifier = Weka::Classifier::Lazy::KStar::Base.new do
  set_options '-M d'
  set_data dataset
  set_class_index 4
end

# cross-validate the trained classifier
puts classifier.cross_validate(3)
</code></pre>

    <link href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2013/09/18/nmatrix-nearing-beta-release/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-18T15:18:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2013/09/18/nmatrix-nearing-beta-release</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As of this writing, NMatrix v0.0.9 is available on RubyGems. It is likely that the next version will be a beta release
candidate, as there&#8217;s only one critical feature still missing (<code>==</code> between matrices of different storage types).</p>

<p>An enormous amount has changed since my last entry.</p>

<h2>New, friendlier constructor</h2>

<p>First and foremost, NMatrix sports a new constructor, based
on <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sciruby-dev/tPwnmPbRR_U/PL0Nc92gdzEJ">helpful comments from folks on the listserv</a>. Here
are some examples of construction:</p>

<pre><code>NMatrix.new([4,4], 0) # 4x4 dense matrix of :int32, all 0
NMatrix.new([4,4], 0.0) # 4x4 dense matrix of :float64, all 0.0
NMatrix.new([4,4], 0.0, dtype: :complex64) # 4x4 dense matrix of :complex64
NMatrix.new([1,4], stype: :yale) # size 4 sparse (Yale) row vector of 0s
NMatrix.new([4,3], [0,1,2]) # 4 rows, 3 columns: gradient across each row from 0 to 2 (int32)
NMatrix.new([4,3], [0,1,2], stype: :yale, default: 0) # same as above, but Yale storage (int32)
NMatrix.new([4,1], stype: :list, dtype: :rational128) # size 4 sparse (list) column vector of rational 0s
NMatrix.new([4,4]) # 4x4 dense matrix containing nils
NMatrix.new([4,4], dtype: :int64) # 4x4 uninitialized dense matrix containing 64-bit integers
NMatrix.new(4)     # same as above
</code></pre>

<p>The different storage types (stypes) have slightly different behaviors when no initialization value is provided. This
may change in the future, but addresses the somewhat different use-cases of these storage types.</p>

<p>I show a variety of examples above, several of which are not particularly wise uses &#8212; for example, the <code>[0,1,2]</code> Yale
gradient, which uses 32-bit integers and must store 11 column indices and pointers (which are most likely unsigned
long integers) in addition to the 11 entries (4 for the always-stored diagonal, 1 for the default, and 6 for the
non-diagonal non-zeros).</p>

<p>The key to understanding the differing construction is the default value. All sparse matrices need a default. Usually we
think of sparse matrices as being zero-based (only non-zero values are stored), but NMatrix now allows other defaults.
However, dense matrices don&#8217;t need defaults, and in fact sometimes it&#8217;s more efficient to allocate them without
initializing them &#8212; such as if they&#8217;re about to store the results of some LAPACK function call. But if they contain
Ruby objects, they <strong>have</strong> to be initialized, which is why they become nil.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re still working out a few bugs in construction. If you find any, please report them in our <a href="http://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/issues">issue tracker</a>.</p>

<h2>Elimination of NVectors</h2>

<p>We removed the NVector class. Frankly, it didn&#8217;t make sense. A vector can&#8217;t have an orientation unless it has multiple
dimensions &#8212; even if some of those dimensions have length 1. Now, vectors and matrices are treated the same in the code.</p>

<p>The good news is that element access (<code>[]</code>) has been rewritten so that the programmer only needs provide the coordinates
whose dimensions are not 1. For example:</p>

<pre><code>n = NMatrix.new([4,1,3], 0) # 3-dimensional matrix of 0s
n[2,1] == n[2,0,1]
=&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>The same rule applies to slicing.</p>

<h2>Slicing improvements</h2>

<p>Aleksey Timin contributed the framework for matrix slicing. Matrices can be sliced by copying or by reference. Modifying
a copy-slice does not modify the original matrix; but modifying a reference slice does.</p>

<p>A copy of some portion of the matrix may be made using <code>NMatrix#slice</code>:</p>

<pre><code>new_matrix = n.slice(0..1,0..2)
</code></pre>

<p>And what appears to be a copy, but is actually a reference, may be made using brackets:</p>

<pre><code>ref = n[0..1,0..2]
</code></pre>

<p>Reference slices may also be modified in a variety of ways:</p>

<pre><code>n[0..4,2..8] = 0   # change all entries to 0
n[0..4,2..8] = [0,1,2]  # change the selected entries to [0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2...]
n[0..4,2..8] = NMatrix.new([3,3], [0,1,2]) # same as above
</code></pre>

<p>For the sake of speed, each of these <code>[]=</code> returns the right-hand value, whether that value is an array, matrix, or
single value. So, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>x = m[0..4,2..8] = n[0..1,0..2] = [1,2,3]
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>x</code> will be equal to <code>[1,2,3]</code> after the evaluation.</p>

<h2>Iteration</h2>

<p>Matrices are now enumerable. There are a variety of enumerators &#8212; namely <code>each_with_indices</code> (and <code>each</code>), <code>each_stored_with_indices</code>,
and <code>each_ordered_stored_with_indices</code>. The first, <code>each</code>, is guaranteed to produce the same iteration regardless of the
storage type. The other two iterate only across the stored entries.</p>

<h2>Elementwise comparisons</h2>

<p>A regular matrix comparison, returning a single boolean, can be accomplished using <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code>. In earlier versions of
NMatrix, the results of the element-wise versions, <code>=~</code>, <code>!~</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, and <code>&lt;=</code>, were matrices of 0s and 1s,
stored using the <code>:byte</code> dtype.</p>

<p>Now, these comparisons return matrices of Ruby objects:</p>

<pre><code>n &lt; m
=&gt; [ true,  false, false, true,
     false, false, false, true,
     true,  true,  true,  true  ]
</code></pre>

<p>Try experimenting with sparse matrices to see how the default value (<code>#default_value</code>) is initialized on the result during an
elementwise comparison.</p>

<h2>Chunky bacon</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m really excited about all of the chunky bacon in our latest release. I feel like things are really coming together
for our library. I&#8217;m also glad to see that people are using it.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of using NMatrix yourself, I strongly encourage it. Although I&#8217;m writing my dissertation, I plan to
prioritize troubleshooting ahead of just about everything else. I want using NMatrix to be an easy choice for every
Rubyist.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

    <link href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2012/12/07/how-to-use-nmatrix-shortcuts/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-07T12:30:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2012/12/07/how-to-use-nmatrix-shortcuts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> This code predates v0.0.9 alpha, which is when the NMatrix constructor changed. Please check the <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/wiki/Getting-started#shortcuts">NMatrix Getting Started guide</a> for the most recent information.</p>


<p>John Woods <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/commit/2b480ce0985affc7218fc341fcb4e5024b30545b">merged my last pull request to NMatrix</a> recently and I wanted to write about why we created these shortcuts and what can be done with them. <!--more--></p>

<h2>The need for shortcuts</h2>

<p>The first iteration of NMatrix shortcuts was written by <a href="https://github.com/dcarrera">Daniel Carrera</a> and sent to the mailing list, where I started working with them. Some discussions, decisions and two pull requests later, we have a working set of methods to create common matrices (<code>zeros</code>, <code>ones</code>, <code>random</code>, etc) and do some cool stuff (<code>column</code> and <code>linspace</code>) very easily.</p>

<p>There are at least two good reasons to have these shortcuts: MATLAB users are going to feel at home, and the shortcuts allow us to prototype and experiment more rapidly. For example, it&#8217;s dead simple to create an identify matrix when you need one:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; require 'nmatrix'

&gt;&gt; matrix = NMatrix.identity(3) # 3x3
=&gt; #&lt;NMatrix:0x007faa5b8cda40shape:[3,3] dtype:float64 stype:dense&gt; 
&gt;&gt; matrix.pp

# [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
# [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
# [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
</code></pre>

<p>And a random matrix to test some operation:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; rand_matrix = NMatrix.random(4) # 4x4
=&gt; #&lt;NMatrix:0x007faa5b01cdd8shape:[4,4] dtype:float64 stype:dense&gt;
&gt;&gt; rand_matrix.pp

# [0.5933103148378577, 0.8556103970281977, 0.7176768395610358, 0.07160353964395305]
# [0.8566365570076784, 0.33925854948960343, 0.5994298479703805, 0.6906794137948586]
# [0.5684593743073485, 0.10273166792035393, 0.46187577773882293, 0.586085963973687]
# [0.8944982538369494, 0.9896291945923837, 0.8787034784673503, 0.5933103148378577]
</code></pre>

<h2>Shortcuts available</h2>

<p>The following list is taken from <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/wiki/NMatrix">NMatrix&#8217;s wiki</a>. All are class methods on <code>NMatrix</code>.</p>

<pre><code>ones(3,3)                    # A 3x3 matrix of ones.
zeros(4,4) or zeroes(4,4)    # Creates a matrix of zeros with dimensions as parameters.
identity(5,5) or eye(5,5)    # A 5x5 identity matrix. Only works with NMatrix.
seq(8)                       # An 8-vector with a sequence of values from 0 to 7.
random(6,6)                  # A 6x6 matrix of random values between 0 and 1.

column(2)                    # Return the 2nd column of the original matrix. Only works with NMatrix.

indgen(8)                    # To make IDL users happy. Same as `seq(8, :int32)`.
findgen(8)                   # Same as `seq(8, :float32)`.
bindgen(8)                   # Same as `seq(8, :byte)`.
cindgen(8)                   # Same as `seq(8, :complex64)`.

linspace(0, pi, 100)         # A vector of 100 values from 0 to pi, inclusive. Only works with NVector.
</code></pre>

<p>The method names are mostly from MATLAB. In the future, when more functionality is added, we&#8217;ll try to create a more &#8220;Ruby-like&#8221; feel to the API. But as these shortcuts do very primitive tasks, there isn&#8217;t any obvious room for improvement. (Feel free to prove us wrong, however!)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll create a separate wiki page for the shortcuts to be able to organize and put more information about how to use them. But I want to create a better RDoc documentation for NMatrix — so the full API will probably be referenced there. I&#8217;ll write a new blog post here when something along these lines is done.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>First, let&#8217;s try normalizing the columns of an NMatrix.</p>

<pre><code>require 'nmatrix'

m = NMatrix.seq(3, :float32)
m.pp

# [0.0, 1.0, 2.0]
# [3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
# [6.0, 7.0, 8.0]

(0 .. m.shape[1] - 1).each do |j|
  col = m.column(j)
    norm = Math.sqrt(col.transpose.dot(col)[0, 0])
    (0 .. m.shape[0] - 1).each { |i| m[i,j] /= norm }
end

m.pp

# [0.0, 0.12309148907661438, 0.20739033818244934]
# [0.4472135901451111, 0.4923659563064575, 0.5184758305549622]
# [0.8944271802902222, 0.861640453338623, 0.8295613527297974]

(0 .. m.shape[1] - 1).each do |j|
  col = m.column(j)
  puts Math.sqrt(col.transpose.dot(col)[0,0])
end

# 0.9999999701976772
# 1.0
# 1.0
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, slice by reference isn&#8217;t working on <code>HEAD</code>, or we could make a few additional improvements (see issue <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/issues/51">#51</a>).</p>

<p>The other thing that I&#8217;ve wanted to do is to use <code>linspace</code> to generate points for plotting sines, cosines, etc. Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>require 'nmatrix'

vector = NVector.linspace(0, Math::PI, 10)
vector.pretty_print

# 0.0
# 0.3490658503988659
# 0.6981317007977318
# 1.0471975511965976
# 1.3962634015954636
# 1.7453292519943295
# 2.0943951023931953
# 2.443460952792061
# 2.792526803190927
# 3.141592653589793

10.times do |i|
  vector[k, 0] = Math::sin(vector[k, 0])
end

vector.pretty_print

# 0.0
# 0.3420201433256687
# 0.6427876096865393
# 0.8660254037844386
# 0.984807753012208
# 0.984807753012208
# 0.8660254037844388
# 0.6427876096865395
# 0.3420201433256689
# 1.2246467991473532e-16
</code></pre>

<p>These results show a happy result, in that we are able to use NMatrix for simple tasks already. Of course, there are problems to be solved, e.g. slice by reference, inversion for all dtypes, eigenvalues. But it&#8217;s going somewhere, it&#8217;s growing.</p>

<p>I hope that by this time next year we&#8217;ll have a very mature linear algebra library (and much more).</p>

    <link href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2012/11/28/spring-2013-sciruby-fellows-selected/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-28T13:46:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2012/11/28/spring-2013-sciruby-fellows-selected</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week we selected three excellent candidates for <a href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2012/09/24/sciruby-receives-ruby-association-grant--fellowships-available/">SciRuby fellowships</a>. We were incredibly pleased to be able to offer so many fellowships, made possible in part by the generosity of an anonymous contributor. <!--more--></p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/agarie">Carlos Agarie</a> will be working half-time starting immediately on providing certain critical functionality to NMatrix and on improving our documentation. Specifically, matrix inversions and determinant calculations both depend upon BLAS, and in some cases CLAPACK. However, the CLAPACK interface is unavailable to most Mac users; and neither BLAS nor LAPACK provides rational support, which is on the NMatrix roadmap. Carlos is a Brazilian exchange student at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/masaomi">Masaomi &#8220;Masa&#8221; Hatakeyama</a> is a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Zurich. He is devoting ten hours per week initially to adding NMatrix support to Ruby/GSL, while also improving the NMatrix unit tests. His work is critical to interoperability between NMatrix and the other SciRuby projects.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="http://github.com/ryanmt">Ryan Taylor</a> is a biochemistry doctoral candidate at Brigham Young University in the United States. Ryan will be working full-time starting in January on NMatrix, and plans to contribute functionality essential to any matrix library&#8212;such as factorizations and decompositions; computations of trace, exponentials, square roots, norms, and tensors; basic statistics; transforms; and solvers.</p>

<p>We also want to take a moment to thank <a href="http://www.symora.com">Symora Networks</a> for its assistance. Specifically, the size of the Ruby Association grant is such that the U.S. requires us to apply for tax status, a somewhat expensive process for an open source project. Symora is providing the bulk of the money required for that application. Thanks also go to our many individual donors, who are just as necessary to this process.</p>

<p>And of course, none of this would be possible without the Ruby Association. They provided us not only with financial resources to grow our project, but also with an endorsement of our vision: Ruby needs scientific packages in order to grow as a language.</p>

    <link href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2012/07/31/major-refactoring-in-the-pipeline/"/>
    <updated>2012-07-31T16:23:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2012/07/31/major-refactoring-in-the-pipeline</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Activity has picked up enormously on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sciruby-dev">our listserv</a> over the last few weeks,
which makes us all very happy.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/chriswailes">Chris Wailes</a> and I have been working on a major refactoring of <a href="http://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix">NMatrix</a>,
our replacement for NArray. You may recall that we released our first alpha (0.0.1) back in April, and that we&#8217;ve been
relatively silent since then.<!--more--></p>

<p>We&#8217;re pleased to announce that our second alpha, NMatrix v0.0.2, should be available as a gem by mid-August.</p>

<p>Our first alpha was a proof of concept. The second alpha is the framework upon which we will build an empire of chunky
bacon.</p>

<p>Chris came up with the idea to convert all of NMatrix&#8217;s Ruby/C template code into C++ templates, and we&#8217;ve been working
on that steadily. These are cleaner and easier to maintain than the C parser-based templates I wrote a few months ago.</p>

<p>In addition, I have incorporated basic slicing, contributed by <a href="http://github.com/flipback">Aleksey Timin</a>, who has been
absolutely essential to our growing project.</p>

<p>One major hiccup has been that NMatrix and NArray conflict with one another when both are included (particularly poor
planning on my part). This means that Ruby/GSL can&#8217;t work with NMatrix without some modifications &#8211; which are underway
in a <a href="http://github.com/SciRuby/rb-gsl">fork</a>. We plan to release fixes for Ruby/GSL and Statsample as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We want to again thank <a href="http://brighterplanet.com">Brighter Planet</a> for their support of our summer coding fellowship.
Little of this would be possible without them.</p>

    <link href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2012/04/11/first-nmatrix-alpha-released/"/>
    <updated>2012-04-11T13:36:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2012/04/11/first-nmatrix-alpha-released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Code in this blog post is very old and likely will not work with the current version of NMatrix. Please check the <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/wiki/">NMatrix wiki</a> for the most recent information.</p>


<p>Two months ago, I <a href="2012/02/11/numeric-matrix-considerations">mentioned the existence of a prototype Ruby linear algebra library</a>, written in C.</p>

<p>I am pleased to announce that yesterday we released our first alpha of said library, <a href="http://sciruby.com/nmatrix/">NMatrix</a> v0.0.1.<!--more--></p>

<h2>Creating Matrices</h2>

<p>There are lots of different ways to create matrices. The first and easiest is to supply dimensions and initial data:</p>

<pre><code>>> n = NMatrix.new(4, 0) # a square 4x4 dense zero matrix
=> #&lt;NMatrix:0x9a57e14shape:[4,4] dtype:int32 stype:dense&gt;
>> n.pretty_print
0  0  0  0
0  0  0  0
0  0  0  0
0  0  0  0
=> nil
</code></pre>


<h2>Data Types</h2>

<p>You may notice that this first matrix defaulted to <tt>dtype=:int32</tt>. NMatrix will try to guess the <i>dtype</i> based on the
first initial value you provide (e.g., <tt>NMatrix.new(4, [0.0, 1])</tt> will be :float32), but you can choose to provide
a <i>dtype</i> in addition to or in lieu of initial values:</p>

<pre><code>>> n = NMatrix.new(4, [0,1], :rational128)
=> #&lt;NMatrix:0x9959e04shape:[4,4] dtype:rational128 stype:dense&gt;
>> n.pretty_print
0/1  1/1  0/1  1/1
0/1  1/1  0/1  1/1
0/1  1/1  0/1  1/1
0/1  1/1  0/1  1/1
>> m = NMatrix.new(4, :int64)  # no initialization of values
=> #&lt;NMatrix:0x99fad68shape:[4,4] dtype:int64 stype:dense&gt;
>> m.pretty_print
-1217641248  161386160  161386100  161385680
161385640  161385520  161385420  161384180
161384120  161381060  161381020  161412140
161411940  161411880  161411840  160879240
=> nil
</code></pre>


<h2>Storage Formats</h2>

<p>The storage type (<i>stype</i>) can also be specified, prior to the dimension argument. However, with sparse storage formats, initial values don&#8217;t make sense, and these matrices will contain zeros by default.</p>

<pre><code># empty list-of-lists-of-lists 4x3x4 matrix
n = NMatrix.new(:list, [4,3,4], :int64)

# Ruby objects in a 'Yale' sparse matrix
m = NMatrix.new(:yale, [5,4], :object)

# A byte matrix containing a gradient
o = NMatrix.new(:dense, 5, [0,1,2,3,4], :byte)
</code></pre>


<p>The matrix <tt>m</tt> created above is a Yale-format sparse matrix, or more specifically, &#8220;new Yale,&#8221; which differs from &#8220;old Yale&#8221; in that the diagonal is stored separately from the non-diagonal elements. Thus, diagonals can be accessed and set in constant time.</p>

<p>Currently, all storage is row-based.</p>

<h3>Conversion</h3>

<p>You can also convert between any of these three stypes using <tt>cast</tt>, e.g.,</p>

<pre><code>n = NMatrix.new(:list, 4, :int64)
n[0,0] = 5
n[0,3] = -2
dense = n.cast(:dense, :int64)
</code></pre>


<h2>Vectors</h2>

<p>Currently, only dense vectors are implemented as a child class of <tt>NMatrix</tt>, and creation is similar:</p>

<pre><code>>> nv = NVector.new(5, :int64)
=> #&lt;NVector:0x9a62328shape:[5,1] dtype:int64 stype:dense orientation:column&gt;

<h2>Math Operations</h2>

<p>Most element-wise mathematical operations are supported for Yale and dense types. These use the basic operators (e.g., +, -, /, *, ==).</p>

<p>For non-element-wise matrix multiplication, use the <tt>dot</tt> instance method of NMatrix. Whole-matrix comparison (returning a single boolean value) is the <tt>equal?</tt> or <tt>eql?</tt> method.</p>

<h2>Road Map</h2>

<p>Much more remains to be written than has been completed. Here are some of our key priorities:</p>

<ul>
<li>determinants</li>
<li>matrix-vector multiplication for Yale</li>
<li>adaptation of SciRuby Matlab file reader to support NMatrix</li>
<li>in-place transposition</li>
</ul>


<p>If you want to get involved, I suggest visiting the <a href="https://github.com/sciruby/nmatrix/issues">NMatrix issue tracker</a>. It will contain not only bugs, but also features that need to be implemented.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We&#8217;re all pretty excited about NMatrix. But we couldn&#8217;t have gotten this far without Masahiro Tanaka&#8217;s <a href="http://narray.rubyforge.org/">NArray</a>, which has served as a model for our library.</p>

<p>And we can&#8217;t do it without your help. A numerical library in Ruby is no small endeavour, and probably requires at least one full-time programmer (which we do not have). Please consider contributing, even if it&#8217;s just by letting us know what you think.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>

    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2012/02/11/numeric-matrix-considerations</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Maybe you&#8217;ve been wondering why the SciRuby people have been so quiet lately.</p>

<p>Mostly, we&#8217;ve been working on <a href="http://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix">NMatrix</a>, which is our prototype linear algebra library, written as a Ruby C extension.<!--more--></p>

<p>So far, we have dense and linked-list-of-linked-lists (or just &#8220;list&#8221;) matrices, which can exist in an essentially unlimited number of dimensions. This week, I implemented the <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/blob/sparse/ext/nmatrix/yale.c">beginnings of a two-dimensional sparse type known as &#8220;new Yale.&#8221;</a> If you&#8217;re curious, check out <em><a href="http://apps.nrbook.com/c/index.html">Numerical Recipes in C</a></em>, pp. 78-79.</p>

<p>&#8220;New Yale&#8221; differs from &#8220;old Yale&#8221; (which SciPy uses for its CSR type) in that the diagonals are accessible in <tt>O(1)</tt> instead of <tt>O(log(n))</tt> time. Most libraries for Yale matrices include conditionals that permit both types to be used together (e.g., multiplying a new Yale matrix by an old Yale matrix).</p>

<p>As I worked through implementation of matrix multiplication for Yale, I realized that matrix libraries are a bottomless pit. One could probably write matrix algorithms forever and still have lots left to do.</p>

<p>So we need to set ourselves some limits.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just whether the diagonal is extracted from the rest of the matrix. It&#8217;s also whether you want to be able to multiply integer-valued matrices by real-valued matrices without an expensive copy operation. It&#8217;s whether you want to be able to multiply dense against Yale matrices or two Yale and list matrices that have different dtypes, or have separate storage for symmetric matrices, and so on.</p>

<p>Some of this can be templated using generators. But the complexity begins to grow to the point where it&#8217;s infeasible to test everything you&#8217;ve implemented. (You also start to get lost in a magical world of function pointers, which is yet another concern.)</p>

<p>So, again, we need to set ourselves some limits.</p>

<p>Where those limits might be, however, I know not. Weigh in on the Google Group, in the comments, or on <a href="https://plus.google.com/109304769076178160953/posts">our Google+ page</a>!</p>

    <updated>2011-11-02T21:39:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2011/11/02/first-pre-alpha-release</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3180369">We made it to the top spot on Hacker News</a> on Halloween (three days ago now). We weren&#8217;t quite prepared for the level of interest generated by that posting, so we&#8217;ve experienced a few growing pains. (Please please please don&#8217;t send us to Slashdot.) <!--more--></p>

<p>But growing pains are a good thing! They are, of course, the result of growth &#8211; which we like!</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve had experienced Ruby developers coming out of the woodwork and admitting &#8211; albeit only after looking over their shoulders &#8211; that they, too, have secretly been using Ruby for science, and are thrilled about this project.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/noahhl">Noah</a> from 37signals offered an extremely helpful piece of advice. He pointed out the way <a href="http://github.com/antirez/redis">redis</a> uses its <a href="https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues?state=open">issue tracker</a> to facilitate contributions from people who aren&#8217;t as familiar with the project status. So now if you want to get involved, instead of checking the Roadmap, you should check the <a href="https://github.com/sciruby/sciruby/issues?sort=created&amp;direction=desc&amp;state=open">SciRuby issue tracker</a>.</p>

<p>We had a couple of people who indicated confusion over what features had already been implemented in SciRuby. The source of the confusion was most likely that we hadn&#8217;t released a gem in a while, but had still been updating the master branch in the repository.</p>

<p>Our plan had been to wait until we had numeric array and matrix support ready before releasing another gem version. But we capitulated, and have now put out a &#8220;pre-alpha,&#8221; version 0.1.3, available through your friendly neighborhood RubyGems. As of this posting, the v0.1.3 tag corresponds to the code in master.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Plotter GUI</h3>


<p>The most useful feature is probably Plotter, which is a GUI for Rubyvis. You can instantiate it in a couple of different ways. I prefer this one:</p>

<pre><code>sciruby-plotter my_test_plot.rb
</code></pre>


<p>You can modify your source file and the plotter should automatically update the plot. If you want to save your plot, push the &#8216;s&#8217; key.</p>

<p>Similar to the plotter is a basic Rubyvis code editor. You can instantiate it from irb by calling <code>SciRuby::Editor.new</code>.</p>

<h3>Datasets</h3>


<p>We thought it would be super cool if SciRuby could be used for a lot of those examples people used to write for R. You know, R has all those cool datasets, like <a href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/faithful.html">Old Faithful&#8217;s eruption times</a>.</p>

<pre><code>faithful = SciRuby::dataset(:r, 'faithful')
</code></pre>


<p>You might be wondering, &#8220;Why do you have to indicate that it comes from R if it only loads R datasets?&#8221; Wonder no more.</p>

<p>I wrote a module for searching online databases for useful datasets as well. It&#8217;s very buggy. Right now it only works on the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world-government-data">Guardian World Government Data repository</a>, which is itself somewhat flaky. In other words, this feature might get removed unless some people express an interest in improving it.</p>

<h3>Statistical Analysis DSL</h3>


<p>Claudio Bustos&#8217; <a href="http://ruby-statsample.rubyforge.org/statsample/Statsample/Analysis.html">Statsample::Analysis</a> has been migrated into SciRuby. It should eventually ease the transition to SciRuby for those who are familiar with R.</p>

<p>It should work almost exactly the same way as the version from Statsample, but you&#8217;ll call it with <code>SciRuby::Analysis</code> instead of <code>Statsample::Analysis</code>.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>As always, if you want to install SciRuby, you should look at the <a href="http://sciruby.com/docs#installation">installation instructions</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2011/08/15/the-challenges-of-copyrights/"/>
    <updated>2011-08-15T19:56:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2011/08/15/the-challenges-of-copyrights</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, I thought it would be fun to translate some of the <em><a href="http://nr.com/">Numerical Recipes</a></em> algorithms into Ruby,
 specifically those for the Gamma distribution and incomplete gamma function. I got them all working pretty well, and
 they were only a hundred or so lines of code altogether.</p>

<p>But a voice in the back of my head said, &#8220;Hey, you should ask Bill Press if he wants to be involved.&#8221; <!--more--></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Press">Bill Press</a>, by the way, is a pretty cool astrophysicist who decided he
 wanted to come work here at UT as a computational biologist instead. He also happens to be first author on <em>Numerical
 Recipes</em>, and a fairly regular attendee at my lab&#8217;s weekly meetings. Once he had to pause my exam to take a call
 from the White House, which was also pretty awesome.</p>

<p>So I emailed Dr. Press to ask him if he&#8217;d be interested in helping out with SciRuby, and specifically if he might be
 willing to donate a copy of NR. He was happy to donate a copy and to help out in whatever way he could, he wrote back,
 but the license for NR wouldn&#8217;t allow us to use the code from the book.</p>

<p>My stomach sank. I had missed that disclaimer, and I was used to dealing with more-or-less public domain (or at least
 GPLed) Ruby code.</p>

<p>The email continued. We should be careful using other libraries, because many of them were illegally derived from
 copyrighted materials.</p>

<p>Several interesting discussions ensued (<a href="https://plus.google.com/108379995018215027591/posts/2AefG8i3nUX">including this public one</a>).
 The take-away is that many people don&#8217;t understand code copyrights (I among them). Consequently, most governments don&#8217;t
 understand copyrights (and it doesn&#8217;t help that U.S. Congress isn&#8217;t exactly full of programmers).</p>

<p>Some were critical of Press and his coauthors for not simply giving us special permission to use his code, but such a
 gimme would be complicated for NR. If they permitted us to use NR code in SciRuby, that code would then be available to
 anyone else to use under the terms of the GPL. I imagine his publisher would be less than thrilled.</p>

<p>So here are some general guidelines for those who want to contribute code to an open-source scientific project,
 particularly SciRuby. Please keep in mind that I am not a lawyer, and take any of this with a grain of salt.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If in doubt, check with the author.</p></li>
<li><p>Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. In other words, honor closed source licenses if you wish your open
source license to be honored.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Always cite your sources.</em> If a copyright owner discovers apparently derivative code without a citation, it&#8217;s easy
to him or her to assume you plagiarized it directly from his or her work. If it has a citation, someone else gets the
blame, or the copyright owner can determine that the code is only <em>apparently</em>, but not <em>actually</em>, derivative.</p></li>
<li><p>If you write your own code, derived from your own math, document it. Scan your derivation and make it public (send it
to our Google Group, for example).</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Any more words of wisdom? Stick them in the comments.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I thought I&#8217;d start by introducing myself. I&#8217;m the project director for SciRuby, and I&#8217;m a molecular biology doctoral
 student at the University of Texas. I work in the <a href="http://marcottelab.org/">Marcotte Lab</a>, and actually occupy the
 former desk (and lab hostname) of John Prince, another of the SciRuby project leads. <!--more--></p>

<p>In addition to working as a graduate student, I am a blogger and an offline political activist &#8211; specifically, a
 community organizer. While I have contributed code to SciRuby already, and plan to continue, my main role here derives
 from my community organizing experience: <strong>I want <em>you</em> to get involved.</strong></p>

<p>In that vein, I have written <a href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2011/08/15/the-challenges-of-copyrights/">a fascinating (and humble) precautionary tale</a>.</p>
