    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We're excited to announce that the Ruby Science Foundation has been selected as
a mentoring organization for <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014">Google Summer of Code 2014</a>!</p>

<p>Last year
was our first year as a mentoring organization, and we had a great group of
students working with us on machine learning, timeseries statistics, the
semantic web, and scientific plotting.</p>

<p>This year we've got a super set of
possible projects including more flexible matrix computations, automatic Ruby
interface generation for scientific libraries, a dataframe library for
structuring and manipulating datasets, interactive plotting, a scientific
notebook, high-performance minimization and integration libraries, and a
semantic web datastore backend for scientific computing.</p>

<p>If you're interested in applying as a student, learning more, or even
contributing independent of GSoC, head over to our <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/sciruby/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2014-Ideas">GSoC 2014 ideas page</a>
to see what projects we think are great.  Don't hesitate to tell us if you've
got an amazing idea for a different project, too! If you're still left
wondering where to start, check out the <a href="https://github.com/sciruby/nmatrix/issues">issue tracker for NMatrix</a>, the matrix computation
library used as the basis for a number of our projects, and our top priority at
the moment.</p>

<p>Good luck to all the GSoC applicants out there, and happy coding!</p>
