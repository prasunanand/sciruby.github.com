working on numerical minimization and integration this summer, Rajat and
Lahiru. Rajat's introductory post appeared two weeks ago.</p>


<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p>I'm Lahiru Lasandun and I'm an undergraduate of University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. I've been selected for
Google Summer of Code 2014 for SciRuby's Minimization and Integration projects.</p>

<p>I was working with SciRuby about a month before GSOC started and did some tests on how to enhance the performance of
these numerical computations. My first idea was to use multi-threading. With the instuctions and guidance of mentors, I
tested more methods such as Erlang multi-processing, the AKKA package of multi-threading, and finally OpenCL. The final
decision was to use OpenCL to enhance computation power of these mathematical computations with the support of multi-cores
and GPUs.</p>

<h2>Minimization Gem</h2>

<p>After GSOC started, I began working on SciRuby's Minimization gem. I proposed multidimensional minimization methods for the
Minimization gem, which already had plenty of unidimensional minimization methods. I chose two non-gradient
and two gradient minimization methods as well as simulated annealing.</p>

<h2>Integration Gem</h2>

<p>For Integration, I proposed to replicate some unidimensional integration methods from the GNU Scientific Library, GSL. Additionally, I proposed to add OpenCL support to enhance performance of integration methods.</p>

<h2>Current Progress</h2>

<p>Currently, I am working on Nelder&ndash;Mead multidimensional minimization
method which is a non-gradient method, including working on the relevant
test cases.</p>

<h2>Introduction to the Minimization and Integration Project</h2>

<p>Hi. My name is Rajat Kapoor and I have been selected to work with
SciRuby for Google Summer of Code 2014.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/minimization">Minimization</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/integration">Integration</a> are two of the
many available gems in the SciRuby suite. My project this year aims to
improve these gems to replicate the functionality provided by GNU's
GSL. I will be trying to implement all the minimization and
integration algorithms present in GSL in pure Ruby, with improvements
as needed, so that these functions are easily accesible to all Ruby
users, while the users which have GSL already installed will have an
advantage in terms of speedy computations.</p>

<h2>What Minimization and Integration actually mean</h2>

<p>Minimization refers to the process of finding out the minimum of a
mathematical function whose values might depend on multiple
variables. Unidimensional minimization restricts these problems to
functions of one single variable. Integration is the same as the very
widely used concept in calculus which basically boils down to finding
the summation of the value of a function at small intervals, when the
width of the intervals in infinitesimally small. I can bet that you
knowingly or unknowingly use both these things on a daily basis.</p>

<h2>The plan</h2>

<p>The project can be broken into two major parts: Minimization and
Integration, as these are two seperate gems.</p>

<p>The Minimization gem can be broken in two parts: unidimensional (or
univariate) and multidimensional (multivariate). With respect to
coding, these two can again be broken down into sub-parts: pure Ruby
implementations and GSL support. The Integration gem will include
the pure Ruby implementations as well as GSL support. Along with this,
some support for symbolic integration will be added for JRuby
users by way of the JScience library.</p>

<h2>Progress</h2>

<p>The pure Ruby implementations of the unidimensional minimization part
are almost finished. I am also working on the GSL support for the same
along with it. I plan to finish up any unidimensional minimization
work by the end of this week and start the work with multidimensional
minimization methods.</p>

<p>Keep watching this blog for more updates regarding my project.</p>
