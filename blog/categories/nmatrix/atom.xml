    <updated>2013-09-18T15:18:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2013/09/18/nmatrix-nearing-beta-release</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As of this writing, NMatrix v0.0.9 is available on RubyGems. It is likely that the next version will be a beta release
candidate, as there's only one critical feature still missing (<code>==</code> between matrices of different storage types).</p>

<p>An enormous amount has changed since my last entry.</p>

<h2>New, friendlier constructor</h2>

<p>First and foremost, NMatrix sports a new constructor, based
on <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sciruby-dev/tPwnmPbRR_U/PL0Nc92gdzEJ">helpful comments from folks on the listserv</a>. Here
are some examples of construction:</p>

<pre><code>NMatrix.new([4,4], 0) # 4x4 dense matrix of :int32, all 0
NMatrix.new([4,4], 0.0) # 4x4 dense matrix of :float64, all 0.0
NMatrix.new([4,4], 0.0, dtype: :complex64) # 4x4 dense matrix of :complex64
NMatrix.new([1,4], stype: :yale) # size 4 sparse (Yale) row vector of 0s
NMatrix.new([4,3], [0,1,2]) # 4 rows, 3 columns: gradient across each row from 0 to 2 (int32)
NMatrix.new([4,3], [0,1,2], stype: :yale, default: 0) # same as above, but Yale storage (int32)
NMatrix.new([4,1], stype: :list, dtype: :rational128) # size 4 sparse (list) column vector of rational 0s
NMatrix.new([4,4]) # 4x4 dense matrix containing nils
NMatrix.new([4,4], dtype: :int64) # 4x4 uninitialized dense matrix containing 64-bit integers
NMatrix.new(4)     # same as above
</code></pre>

<p>The different storage types (stypes) have slightly different behaviors when no initialization value is provided. This
may change in the future, but addresses the somewhat different use-cases of these storage types.</p>

<p>I show a variety of examples above, several of which are not particularly wise uses --- for example, the <code>[0,1,2]</code> Yale
gradient, which uses 32-bit integers and must store 11 column indices and pointers (which are most likely unsigned
long integers) in addition to the 11 entries (4 for the always-stored diagonal, 1 for the default, and 6 for the
non-diagonal non-zeros).</p>

<p>The key to understanding the differing construction is the default value. All sparse matrices need a default. Usually we
think of sparse matrices as being zero-based (only non-zero values are stored), but NMatrix now allows other defaults.
However, dense matrices don't need defaults, and in fact sometimes it's more efficient to allocate them without
initializing them --- such as if they're about to store the results of some LAPACK function call. But if they contain
Ruby objects, they <strong>have</strong> to be initialized, which is why they become nil.</p>

<p>We're still working out a few bugs in construction. If you find any, please report them in our <a href="http://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/issues">issue tracker</a>.</p>

<h2>Elimination of NVectors</h2>

<p>We removed the NVector class. Frankly, it didn't make sense. A vector can't have an orientation unless it has multiple
dimensions --- even if some of those dimensions have length 1. Now, vectors and matrices are treated the same in the code.</p>

<p>The good news is that element access (<code>[]</code>) has been rewritten so that the programmer only needs provide the coordinates
whose dimensions are not 1. For example:</p>

<pre><code>n = NMatrix.new([4,1,3], 0) # 3-dimensional matrix of 0s
n[2,1] == n[2,0,1]
=&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>The same rule applies to slicing.</p>

<h2>Slicing improvements</h2>

<p>Aleksey Timin contributed the framework for matrix slicing. Matrices can be sliced by copying or by reference. Modifying
a copy-slice does not modify the original matrix; but modifying a reference slice does.</p>

<p>A copy of some portion of the matrix may be made using <code>NMatrix#slice</code>:</p>

<pre><code>new_matrix = n.slice(0..1,0..2)
</code></pre>

<p>And what appears to be a copy, but is actually a reference, may be made using brackets:</p>

<pre><code>ref = n[0..1,0..2]
</code></pre>

<p>Reference slices may also be modified in a variety of ways:</p>

<pre><code>n[0..4,2..8] = 0   # change all entries to 0
n[0..4,2..8] = [0,1,2]  # change the selected entries to [0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2...]
n[0..4,2..8] = NMatrix.new([3,3], [0,1,2]) # same as above
</code></pre>

<p>For the sake of speed, each of these <code>[]=</code> returns the right-hand value, whether that value is an array, matrix, or
single value. So, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>x = m[0..4,2..8] = n[0..1,0..2] = [1,2,3]
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>x</code> will be equal to <code>[1,2,3]</code> after the evaluation.</p>

<h2>Iteration</h2>

<p>Matrices are now enumerable. There are a variety of enumerators --- namely <code>each_with_indices</code> (and <code>each</code>), <code>each_stored_with_indices</code>,
and <code>each_ordered_stored_with_indices</code>. The first, <code>each</code>, is guaranteed to produce the same iteration regardless of the
storage type. The other two iterate only across the stored entries.</p>

<h2>Elementwise comparisons</h2>

<p>A regular matrix comparison, returning a single boolean, can be accomplished using <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code>. In earlier versions of
NMatrix, the results of the element-wise versions, <code>=~</code>, <code>!~</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, and <code>&lt;=</code>, were matrices of 0s and 1s,
stored using the <code>:byte</code> dtype.</p>

<p>Now, these comparisons return matrices of Ruby objects:</p>

<pre><code>n &lt; m
=&gt; [ true,  false, false, true,
     false, false, false, true,
     true,  true,  true,  true  ]
</code></pre>

<p>Try experimenting with sparse matrices to see how the default value (<code>#default_value</code>) is initialized on the result during an
elementwise comparison.</p>

<h2>Chunky bacon</h2>

<p>I'm really excited about all of the chunky bacon in our latest release. I feel like things are really coming together
for our library. I'm also glad to see that people are using it.</p>

<p>If you're thinking of using NMatrix yourself, I strongly encourage it. Although I'm writing my dissertation, I plan to
prioritize troubleshooting ahead of just about everything else. I want using NMatrix to be an easy choice for every
Rubyist.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

    <link href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2012/12/07/how-to-use-nmatrix-shortcuts/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-07T12:30:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2012/12/07/how-to-use-nmatrix-shortcuts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> This code predates v0.0.9 alpha, which is when the NMatrix constructor changed. Please check the <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/wiki/Getting-started#shortcuts">NMatrix Getting Started guide</a> for the most recent information.</p>


<p>John Woods <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/commit/2b480ce0985affc7218fc341fcb4e5024b30545b">merged my last pull request to NMatrix</a> recently and I wanted to write about why we created these shortcuts and what can be done with them. <!--more--></p>

<h2>The need for shortcuts</h2>

<p>The first iteration of NMatrix shortcuts was written by <a href="https://github.com/dcarrera">Daniel Carrera</a> and sent to the mailing list, where I started working with them. Some discussions, decisions and two pull requests later, we have a working set of methods to create common matrices (<code>zeros</code>, <code>ones</code>, <code>random</code>, etc) and do some cool stuff (<code>column</code> and <code>linspace</code>) very easily.</p>

<p>There are at least two good reasons to have these shortcuts: MATLAB users are going to feel at home, and the shortcuts allow us to prototype and experiment more rapidly. For example, it's dead simple to create an identify matrix when you need one:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; require 'nmatrix'

&gt;&gt; matrix = NMatrix.identity(3) # 3x3
=&gt; #&lt;NMatrix:0x007faa5b8cda40shape:[3,3] dtype:float64 stype:dense&gt; 
&gt;&gt; matrix.pp

# [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
# [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
# [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
</code></pre>

<p>And a random matrix to test some operation:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; rand_matrix = NMatrix.random(4) # 4x4
=&gt; #&lt;NMatrix:0x007faa5b01cdd8shape:[4,4] dtype:float64 stype:dense&gt;
&gt;&gt; rand_matrix.pp

# [0.5933103148378577, 0.8556103970281977, 0.7176768395610358, 0.07160353964395305]
# [0.8566365570076784, 0.33925854948960343, 0.5994298479703805, 0.6906794137948586]
# [0.5684593743073485, 0.10273166792035393, 0.46187577773882293, 0.586085963973687]
# [0.8944982538369494, 0.9896291945923837, 0.8787034784673503, 0.5933103148378577]
</code></pre>

<h2>Shortcuts available</h2>

<p>The following list is taken from <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/wiki/NMatrix">NMatrix's wiki</a>. All are class methods on <code>NMatrix</code>.</p>

<pre><code>ones(3,3)                    # A 3x3 matrix of ones.
zeros(4,4) or zeroes(4,4)    # Creates a matrix of zeros with dimensions as parameters.
identity(5,5) or eye(5,5)    # A 5x5 identity matrix. Only works with NMatrix.
seq(8)                       # An 8-vector with a sequence of values from 0 to 7.
random(6,6)                  # A 6x6 matrix of random values between 0 and 1.

column(2)                    # Return the 2nd column of the original matrix. Only works with NMatrix.

indgen(8)                    # To make IDL users happy. Same as `seq(8, :int32)`.
findgen(8)                   # Same as `seq(8, :float32)`.
bindgen(8)                   # Same as `seq(8, :byte)`.
cindgen(8)                   # Same as `seq(8, :complex64)`.

linspace(0, pi, 100)         # A vector of 100 values from 0 to pi, inclusive. Only works with NVector.
</code></pre>

<p>The method names are mostly from MATLAB. In the future, when more functionality is added, we'll try to create a more "Ruby-like" feel to the API. But as these shortcuts do very primitive tasks, there isn't any obvious room for improvement. (Feel free to prove us wrong, however!)</p>

<p>I'll create a separate wiki page for the shortcuts to be able to organize and put more information about how to use them. But I want to create a better RDoc documentation for NMatrix — so the full API will probably be referenced there. I'll write a new blog post here when something along these lines is done.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>First, let's try normalizing the columns of an NMatrix.</p>

<pre><code>require 'nmatrix'

m = NMatrix.seq(3, :float32)
m.pp

# [0.0, 1.0, 2.0]
# [3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
# [6.0, 7.0, 8.0]

(0 .. m.shape[1] - 1).each do |j|
  col = m.column(j)
    norm = Math.sqrt(col.transpose.dot(col)[0, 0])
    (0 .. m.shape[0] - 1).each { |i| m[i,j] /= norm }
end

m.pp

# [0.0, 0.12309148907661438, 0.20739033818244934]
# [0.4472135901451111, 0.4923659563064575, 0.5184758305549622]
# [0.8944271802902222, 0.861640453338623, 0.8295613527297974]

(0 .. m.shape[1] - 1).each do |j|
  col = m.column(j)
  puts Math.sqrt(col.transpose.dot(col)[0,0])
end

# 0.9999999701976772
# 1.0
# 1.0
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, slice by reference isn't working on <code>HEAD</code>, or we could make a few additional improvements (see issue <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/issues/51">#51</a>).</p>

<p>The other thing that I've wanted to do is to use <code>linspace</code> to generate points for plotting sines, cosines, etc. Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>require 'nmatrix'

vector = NVector.linspace(0, Math::PI, 10)
vector.pretty_print

# 0.0
# 0.3490658503988659
# 0.6981317007977318
# 1.0471975511965976
# 1.3962634015954636
# 1.7453292519943295
# 2.0943951023931953
# 2.443460952792061
# 2.792526803190927
# 3.141592653589793

10.times do |i|
  vector[k, 0] = Math::sin(vector[k, 0])
end

vector.pretty_print

# 0.0
# 0.3420201433256687
# 0.6427876096865393
# 0.8660254037844386
# 0.984807753012208
# 0.984807753012208
# 0.8660254037844388
# 0.6427876096865395
# 0.3420201433256689
# 1.2246467991473532e-16
</code></pre>

<p>These results show a happy result, in that we are able to use NMatrix for simple tasks already. Of course, there are problems to be solved, e.g. slice by reference, inversion for all dtypes, eigenvalues. But it's going somewhere, it's growing.</p>

<p>I hope that by this time next year we'll have a very mature linear algebra library (and much more).</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Major Refactoring in the Pipeline]]></title>
    <link href="http://sciruby.com/blog/2012/07/31/major-refactoring-in-the-pipeline/"/>
    <updated>2012-07-31T16:23:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://sciruby.com/blog/2012/07/31/major-refactoring-in-the-pipeline</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Activity has picked up enormously on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sciruby-dev">our listserv</a> over the last few weeks,
which makes us all very happy.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/chriswailes">Chris Wailes</a> and I have been working on a major refactoring of <a href="http://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix">NMatrix</a>,
our replacement for NArray. You may recall that we released our first alpha (0.0.1) back in April, and that we've been
relatively silent since then.<!--more--></p>

<p>We're pleased to announce that our second alpha, NMatrix v0.0.2, should be available as a gem by mid-August.</p>

<p>Our first alpha was a proof of concept. The second alpha is the framework upon which we will build an empire of chunky
bacon.</p>

<p>Chris came up with the idea to convert all of NMatrix's Ruby/C template code into C++ templates, and we've been working
on that steadily. These are cleaner and easier to maintain than the C parser-based templates I wrote a few months ago.</p>

<p>In addition, I have incorporated basic slicing, contributed by <a href="http://github.com/flipback">Aleksey Timin</a>, who has been
absolutely essential to our growing project.</p>

<p>One major hiccup has been that NMatrix and NArray conflict with one another when both are included (particularly poor
planning on my part). This means that Ruby/GSL can't work with NMatrix without some modifications -- which are underway
in a <a href="http://github.com/SciRuby/rb-gsl">fork</a>. We plan to release fixes for Ruby/GSL and Statsample as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We want to again thank <a href="http://brighterplanet.com">Brighter Planet</a> for their support of our summer coding fellowship.
Little of this would be possible without them.</p>
